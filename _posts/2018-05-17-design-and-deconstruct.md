We where set [a task]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/deconstructPrac/ChemistryCurriculumandMethodologyInvestigationsFolioDeconstructDesignTask18.pdf) to make a deconstruct and design prac suitable for a stage 2 SACE chemistry class, along with a risk assessment for it. We were given [an outline of the SACE assessment requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/deconstructPrac/ChemistryCurriculumandMethodologyDeconstructDesignOutlineC&M18.pdf), and [an example of a deconstruct and design prac]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/deconstructPrac/Stg2ChemDeconstructionInvestigationAnalysisofAnalgesicsC&M18.pdf). 

Because I missed the second day of the intensive, instead of making my own prac Glen invited me to come work with him on the next prac he was planning for his year 12 chemistry students. We tested an indicator (o-cresol red) at different pH's to see if we could see a visible interaction with calcium ions in solution, see the photo below. We didn't find any visible interaction, but figured there might be a detectable interaction under more accurate UV-vis measurement. He had me write up the documents for the prac, but since it's a live prac I'll omit links to the files for now.

TODO: Upload the files once the prac has been done.
TODO: Tag this assignment with relevant APST standards.
