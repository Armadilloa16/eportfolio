Today I completed the Keeping Safe: Child Protection Curriculum training through SHINE SA. I got [my certificate of qualification]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/qualifications/KS-CPC.pdf) at the end of it too. 

This was interesting, I can see lots of interesting opportunities to make this a fun learning experience with kids, and some of the material taught does seem very important, the course itself seemed to drag on though, and it was difficult to maintain concentration as the day went on. It would be interesting to try and teach the CPC in schools though. 

The instructor did also go through a number of techniques to prompt student engagement (as she could see we were struggling to keep paying attention), and these where really useful little tips and tricks I could use in practice.
