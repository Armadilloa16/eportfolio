The Seminar 4 task was to: 

1. Read Chapter 3 of Churchill et al. (2013)[^Churchill2013], Chapter 4 of Brady and Kennedy (2012)[^Brady2012], and Klenowski & Wyatt-Smith (2010).
2. Reflect on the seminar presentation and readings.
3. Provide examples of assessment **of**, **as**, and **for** of learning from my experiences either at school or in my studies, and distinguish the differences between these three purposes of assessment.
4. Why does Vygotsky's ZPD play such an important role in assessment and planning for learning?
5. Add 250 words to your eportfolio in response to these questions.

These different types of assessment can be distinguished simply by their purpose:
 - Assessment **of** learning: to measure how successfully something has been learnt.
 - Assessment **as** learning: to serve as a learning exercise itself.
 - Assessment **for** learning: to aid in learning.


Examples,
 - Assessment **of** learning: Tests, Exams, etc.
 - Assessment **as** learning: Leading questions can often be used to scaffold students learning, so what seems like assessment (asking them a question) can actually be a learning exercise. A more traditional example might be something like a research assignment --- although it is an assessment task, the process of completing the task will result in learning as the student researches the topic. My PhD thesis for example, was an assessment item, but the process of writing it involved a lot of learning, not only about the topic but also about how to write, how to organise large documents, even how to get a book printed and bound.
 - Assessment **for** learning: formative assessment, as emphasised by [^Black2010], is the classic example. A pre-quiz for example, when the first thing you do in a subject or topic is a formative quiz the purpose will often be to inform the teacher about the existing knowledge of the students, so that they can adjust the scaffolding and/ or revision needed **for** their effective learning. A nice example of a combination of these two is an opening question I often ask of students who come to the maths learning centre for help "What can you tell me about that?", it is an open question which they can answer however they like, it informs me about their level of understanding, and it is even "assessed" in the sense that I respond to their answers, give feedback, offer further guidance. 

Vygotsky's ZPD is obviously a relevant concept in many of the above examples. Particularly in formative assessment, and such. The goal in so many of these teaching situations is to pitch the lesson in the ZPD of the students. To do that as a teacher you need to know where the ZPD of the students is --- hence formative assessments, assessment **for** learning --- and you need to guide and aid the students to complete the tasks in their ZPD (by definition of the ZPD), and some of the examples above of assessment **as** learning illustrate ways of doing this through assessment. Assessment **of** learning, on the other hand serves more of a feedback role for the teacher --- were you successful at pitching your teaching to the ZPD of your students? Have they successfully learnt the material, etc.
