We were tasked to make a topic folio: essentially a unit plan along with all the necessary associated materials and resources to teach a topic in Stage 2 Chemistry. I picked Part 1 of Topic 3: Organic and Biological Chemistry (Subtopics 3.1-3.6). [Instructions and rubric for the task]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemFolio/TopicTeachingFolio.pdf) were provided, as well as a fair amount of examples and such.

This is the same topic as [my SAT task]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-11-chem-SAT %}) was for, which was intentional as the SAT was intended to be a final summative assessment task for the topic folio.

I submitted two files for my Topic Folio, [a Unit Plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemFolio/Unit_Plan.docx), which actually includes alot more than just the unit plan, and [a resources zip archive](https://www.dropbox.com/s/523ozgrjqn1unvg/resources.zip?dl=0), which includes additional resources. Of note is that alot of the material for my Topic Folio (representing a good chunk of the work I put into it) is [the prezi](https://prezi.com/view/xgYTeGVWG4WSMVQpqesk/), which is not contained in either of those files, but rather is hosted on the prezi website, I included a link to this in the Unit Plan document.

TODO: Decide if I want to include all the examples and shit for this, got a lot of good material from Glen I should make available somewhere at some point, just need to put some thought into how to go about that.

TODO: Add APST Standard links
