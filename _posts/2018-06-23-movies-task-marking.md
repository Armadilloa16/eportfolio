I marked a complete classes [movies DI]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/resources/Movies_DI_task_sheet.pdf) this weekend. My mentor teacher helped with marking the other class. Similar to the [inertia prac for science]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-20-inertia-report-marking %}), giving them this DI was one of the [first things I did with them]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-08-full-day-of-teaching %}), and so they had been working on it for the whole time I had them.

TODO: I haven't include any of the reports themselves as they include identifying details of the students, but maybe I could anonymise some examples to use as evidence.
