In the first three weeks I was still getting to know the class, and still getting aclimatised so I didn't yet feel very comfortable innovating or trying different things/ coming up with my own ideas, so i let my mentor teacher drive the teaching for the most part. For this reason we decided to go with the summative assessment item my mentor teacher had planned on giving them based on an activity done in the previous term. In hindsight I think this was a bad idea, and my mentor teacher agreed, in that the task was very linear and limiting, and was not my own original idea and so the lack of ownership I felt for it led to pretty mediocre results when delivered to the students. If I was to teach a similar unit again, I would keep the intro and wrap-up activities and replace the assessment item with an investigation based around one of those activities (either the workplace data or the gapminder graphs).

Before my first lesson with the class I discussed with my mentor teacher what kind of lesson-planning process they wanted from me. At first we adopted a process of collaboratively writing a google slides presentation as a form of lesson planning, although later as my mentor teacher saw my teaching and began to trust that he could just let me teach with class with minimal supervision, even this became less often and lesson planning was mostly relegated to informal verbal discussions between me and my mentor teacher. For this reason I don't have traditional 'lesson plans' for this unit, instead having planned the lessons around what needed to be done in the lesson and around the learning objects and activities, which I will include here.

I discussed with my mentor how to start the statistics topic and wanted to start with an open ended question focused on some workplace data to try and get the students to explore the data and find something interesting. After some discussion I suggested using (Gapminder)[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/] instead, and after taking a look at it my mentor teacher got on board with that idea.

# Introduction Activity (Gapminder, Week 1)

We opened the first lesson on the new topic (statistics), with [a motivational video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13JqYVHErcnAWDWz6wvbxpbUBQ3T6Lcet) which we would link back at the end of the of topic, but for now linked to the idea that having a whole bunch of awesome data, or amazing analysis, is completely useless unless you can communicate why it is important to someone else. This bridged the link to the activity which we then kicked off on interpreting data. We introduced this activity with the aid of our [`lesson-plan slides']({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/bhs/year10maths/stats/20180725_lesson_slides.pdf). We got students in groups to choose a chart type at random out of a cup, go on [the Gapminder website](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/) and find something that sparked their interest, and present on it using their chart type at the end of the week. This served as an intro to the topic, as well as an open-ended activity to push them outside of their usual comfort zone and present to their peers while practicing their communication skills.

# Sumative Task (Memory Game, Week 2 into 3)

In week 2 we gave them the summative assignment for the topic and started helping them through it step by step. I made some videos (flipped learning) to extend some students into some programming.

# Wrap-up Activity (Workplace Data, end of Week 3)

In week 3 we helped them finish off their assignment, and on the last day of week 3 we introduced the next topic: indices. I quickly went through the index laws.







TODO: Flesh out the discussion, and illustrate with evidence.
