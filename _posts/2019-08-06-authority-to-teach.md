Last Friday I submitted my application for the Employable Teachers Register (2019) in the Department of Education. I rushed my application, putting together a minimal viable CV and personal statement as quickly as possible because I was asked to go out to Edward John Eyre High School in Whyalla to do a week of TRT in the week starting on the 12th of August, and I really wanted to make it happen. With some help from the leadership team there who wanted to get me out there as well, my application was fast-tracked and I got my [authority to teach letter]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/qualifications/4642484_Authority_to_Teach.pdf) today. I'd still like to go back and do some more work on my ETR personal statement, but maybe after the week of TRT I'll have some more time and also some more to write about, potentially.
