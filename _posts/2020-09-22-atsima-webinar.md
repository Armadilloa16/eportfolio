I watched the ATSIMA webinar today, which was actually really interesting and thought provoking. I liked the format of one talk by a white-anglo teacher about "best practices" and good pedagogical methodology, in juxtaposition to the talk by a indigenous mathematics educator, in an attempt to cross-polinate these communities and to prompt us, the audience, to find connects between them.
