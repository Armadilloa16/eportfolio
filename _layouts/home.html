  Welcome! My name is Lyron Winderbaum, I am a statistician and pre-service teacher, and this is my teaching e-portfolio. If you are here, you are probably looking for some information about me. This site is organised into three pages:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog"><strong>Reflections:</strong></a> contains all of my posts and reflections in a blog-style presentation. This includes all my personal development, examples of teaching with evidence, and mostly includes at least a short reflection on each item. The material here can be sorted and organized by various tags to find specific things.
    <li> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst"><strong>Standards:</strong></a> A list of all 37 <a href="https://www.aitsl.edu.au/teach/standards">Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL)</a> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/APST.pdf">Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST)</a>, with a short discussion/ reflection on each with links to evidence posted in the reflections.
    <li> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/"><strong>About me:</strong></a> This page.
  </ul>
  
  This page has some information about me, and is organised under the following headings:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="#statement"><strong>Personal Teaching Statement:</strong></a> My perspective of teaching, the role of a teacher, and the kind of teacher I aspire to be. </li>
    <li> <a href="#background"><strong>Short History:</strong></a> Where I am from and how I came to be a teacher.</li>
	<li> <a href="#influences"><strong>Influences and Hobbies:</strong></a> Some deeper insight into the people and things that influences me to believe what I believe, and become the person I am, as well as some of my general ``extra-curricular'' interests. </li>
    <li> <a href="#cv"><strong>R&eacutesumâ€Œ&eacute:</strong></a> A concise summary of my qualifications, skills and professional employment history. </li>
  </ul>


  
  <h1 id="statement">Personal Teaching Statement</h1>
	
	Initially I wrote <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-04-08-personal-statement %}">a personal statement based on my values</a>. This personal statement is instead more focused on specific examples of my practice, and is organised under three main APST headings.
  
  <h2>Professional Knowledge</h2>

  <p>For students to learn and excel they need to feel comfortable and safe. As such, an affective approach to student wellbeing is crucial. By producing an environment in which students can feel safe, I can help them to discover their strengths and excel. I do this by building relationships and rapport with students. This allows for open communication between me and my students. I use this communication to adjust and differentiate my teaching to be appropriate to the specific students. For example in my teaching practicum I had two classes of year 10 maths, one of which enjoyed group work and the other less so. In particular, although several students enjoyed it a few expressed feelings of discomfort at being required to complete work in small groups. In response to this feedback, I adjusted the next task I gave both classes, offering them a choice between two activities, one being a group task and the other individual. In one class, most of the class opted into the group work, while in the other class most opted for individual work. The students expressed their gratitude for being given the option, but beyond that some of the students who struggled to meet a passing grade in the first task, excelled when given the choice to work individually thereby demonstrating the impact of tailoring the methods to cater to their preferred method of learning.</p>

  <h2>Professional Practice</h2>
  
  <img src="files/photos/movember2017.jpg" alt="Movember2017" hspace="20" style="float:right;width:220px">  
  
  <p>Central to my teaching ideology is to recognise each individual students unique strengths, and to encourage the development of relationships based on mutual respect of each others unique strengths. In my practice I always look out for unique learning opportunities to encourage student participation. For example, on practicum I had a year 10 science class in which I introduced their next summative practical: to bounce balls in an investigation of conservation of energy. When first introducing the class I left what the independent variables would be deliberately vague, and instructed the students to come up with some on their own instead of giving them the scaffolding document in which it was suggested that different types of balls be used and dropped from different heights as the two independent variables. Some students struggled, and for those I had some copies of the scaffolding document on hand to help them along, but introducing the task in this way gave other students the opportunities to suggest different variables, not suggested in the scaffolding document. One student in particular came up with the idea of using a slightly deflated beachball or soccerball, and then inflating it to see the difference inflation made. This was particularly notable because this student had not been particularly engaged in class, and had had middling academic success in the previous term showing consistent disinterest in class up until this point. But when I came to the next class with a pump, ready to test their idea they immediately engaged with the task, was compleetly self-driven, and produced an excellent prac report to describe it. Allowing students to engage with material and make it their own can engage students that might otherwise be disinterested and this was one of the most valuable memories I took from practicum. </p>
  
  <h2>Professional Engagement</h2>
  
  <p>Learning is a passion of mine, and I have never stopped learning. Through discussion with colleagues and self-reflection I identify my weaknesses and areas of ignorance, and constantly work to learn. There is always more to learn, more to understand. I particularly benefit from open discussions with colleagues who hold very different views/ beliefs and use very different teaching methods to me, as this is when I learn the most. For example ...</p>

  <h1 id="background">Short History</h1>

  <p>I was born in Jerusalem, Israel, in 1989. My family moved to Australia in 1992, when I was three years old, and since then I grew up in the Adelaide hills until I moved out of home into the inner suburbs in 2007. After graduating highschool in 2006 I went straight to university, studying a Bachelor of Science. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do yet exactly, but I knew that whatever it was it would be somewhere in the Science/ Maths areas. I changed my mind about what I wanted to major in every year of my undergraduate degree, finally graduating in 2010 with three majors: Chemistry, Pure Mathematics, and Statistics.</p>
    
  <img src="files/photos/brainrack.jpg" alt="Brainrack" hspace="20" style="float:left;width:300px">

  <p>In 2011 I started (and completed) an honours degree through the School of Mathematical Sciences in the discipline of statistics, working on a project analysing LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) geochemical data from pyrite sections under the supervision of Associate Professor Andrew Metcalfe. At the same time (also in 2011) I started teaching at the University of Adelaide: tutoring, marking, and demonstrating through the School of Mathematical Sciences, and also through the Maths Learning Centre --- where I developed a love for helping people find the joy in mathematics. Together with Dr. David Butler and a few other people we coined a term for this, ``mathefreude'', which we later discovered is actually already a word (which is awesome, by the way). Working in the Maths Learning Centre is also when the seeds where first planted that would later grow into my passion for teaching, although I don't think I was fully aware of that at the time.</p> 
  
  <p>In 2012 I continued my trajectory into academia, beginning my PhD project on ``The Statistical Analysis of Proteomics Imaging Mass Spectrometry Data'' under the supervision of Associate Professor Inge Koch, which I worked on until it was accepted for the degree in 2016. During that time interspersed between my PhD candidature I worked as a research assistant, but also continued teaching. I eventually dropped the teaching work through the School of Mathematical Sciences, but continuing to work at the Maths Learning Centre throughout.</p>

  <p> After I completed my PhD I continued working in the field as a postdoctoral research assistant for over a year (including all of 2017). At the beginning of 2017 I was asked to take on a full time research position at the University of Adelaide, which I initially accepted, but as a consequence I had to give up on teaching through the Maths Learning Centre. It was during this time that I realised the importance teaching had grown to have for me. I was unhappy in academia and I missed teaching. I starting going into the Maths Learning Centre and helping students there in my free time, on my lunch breaks and so on. It was then that I realised... if there is a job that I enjoy so much that I would volunteer to go and do it in my free time... that is probably what I should be doing with my life. Even having this realisation, changing direction is difficult, careers seem to have momentum and they pull you along with them. Initially I only took a half-step towards teaching, asking to go down to a part-time load of research so that I could start teaching again because of my realisation of its importance to me. This satisfied me for a time, but when my research funding ran out at the end of 2017 I realised it was an opportunity to focus all my time and efforts on my passion, and so I enrolled in the Master of Teaching program. </p>

  <h1 id="influences">Influences and Hobbies</h1>
  
  <img src="files/photos/shedidit.jpg" alt="Shedidit" hspace="20" style="float:left;width:240px">

  <p>Along the way I have been inspired by many people. Dan Kortchak inspired me to think about problems from the perspective of a systems or software engineer and not just that of a mathematician. The writing of Paul Halmos, first recommended to me by my PhD supervisor Inge, inspired me to be a better communicator with it's concise eloquence. But most of all the enthusiasm and pedagogy of David Butler's teaching practice at the Maths Learning Centre truely inspired me to be a better teacher.</p>

  <p>Brendan Bentley once said in the first intensive week of my Master of Teaching program, "Don't Assume", and that hit a powerful chord with me, reflecting my view on the importance of behaviour and the use of language in creating welcoming environments. In context, he was pointing out that when a student shows up late or falls asleep in class, you don't know what they have been through --- maybe their mum is sick in the hospital and they where up all night caring for her, you have no idea what they've been through. Don't Assume. That resonated with me.</p>
  
  <p>I enjoy rockclimbing, having been involved in the Climbing Club of South Australia (CCSA), the Adelaide University Mountain Club (AUMC), and University of South Australia Rockclimbing Club since 2013. I also enjoy cycling, hiking, and rogaining. I also enjoy go/igo/weiqi/baduk and helped run the University of Adelaide Go and Chess club in 2009-2011. I've also been interested in puzzles and been involved in the University of Adelaide Puzzle Club and later One Hundred Factorial group 2010-present.</p>
