  Welcome! My name is Lyron Winderbaum, and this is my portfolio. This page has some information about me, including:

  <h1 id="statement">Personal Statement</h1>
  
  <p>I aspire to be the kind of teacher that creates a safe environment in which students can interact and learn. <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-4">APST 4</a>)--> I think achieving this goal will be a lifelong journey, and not an easy one. Three core values of mine sit at the centre of my strategy for achieving this goal:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#lifelong-learning">Lifelong Learning</a></li>
    <li><a href="#transparency">Transparency</a></li>
    <li><a href="#dont-assume">Inclusive Language and Behavior</a></li>
  </ul></p>

  <h2 id="lifelong-learning">Lifelong Learning</h2>
    
  <p>In order to create a safe environment for students to interact and learn I will need to tackle obstacles of many different types: social, cultural, academic, bureaucratic, political. Perhaps most importantly of all I will need to embrace and encourage constant and ongoing self-reflection and constructive criticism. Naturally, these processes will lead to a life of constant learning <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-1">APST 1</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-2">APST 2</a>)--> and development <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-6">APST 6</a>)--> on my part as I constantly strive to improve. I embrace this, and actively seek it, relishing each chance to learn and improve.</p>

  <h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>
  
  <p>I value transparency highly, and aspire to be as transparent as possible in my teaching as well as in my personal development. Providing students with indepth feedback <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-5">APST 5</a>)--> is crucial for supporting learning, and I think being transparent in my assessment tasks can support this goal well. My hope is that transparency can not only improve feedback to students, but also demonstrate my dedication to integrity and encouraging collaboration. My hope that transparency will encourage collaboration applies not only to collaboration with students, but with colleagues, parents, and the community at large as well. I hope that through transparency I can also find ways to encourage stakeholders to give me feedback on how I can improve my teaching. I expect interaction with colleagues, parents, students, and the community at large <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-7">APST 7</a>)--> to provide some of the most useful information for continual improvement as a teacher, which is my day-to-day goal even while my ultimate goal remains to create a safe environment in which students can interact and learn.</p>

  <h2 id="dont-assume">Inclusive Language and Behavior</h2>
  
  <p>I think thoughtful behavior and use of language are powerful tools for communicating to those around us that they are safe, not being judged, and welcome. Although sometimes these things can be subtle, I believe the impact of these subtleties can be anything but. Small and perhaps seemingly innocuous adjustments to our behavior and use of language can create massive shifts in the way people around us feel and perceive us. I think developing keener awareness of the impact of my own behaviors and use of language, and making continual adjustments, will be key to creating environments in which students can feel safe and welcome, as well as being important in developing professional relationships with colleagues, parents, and more.</p>

  

  <h1 id="background">A Short History</h1>

  <p>I was born in Jerusalem, Israel, in 1989. My family moved to Australia in 1992, when I was three years old, and since then I grew up in the Adelaide hills until I moved out of home into the inner suburbs in 2007. After graduating highschool in 2006 I went straight to university, studying a Bachelor of Science. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do yet exactly, but I knew that whatever it was it would be somewhere in the Science/ Maths areas. I changed my mind about what I wanted to major in every year of my undergraduate degree, finally graduating in 2010 with three majors: Chemistry, Pure Mathematics, and Statistics.</p>

  <p>In 2011 I started (and completed) an honours degree through the School of Mathematical Sciences in the discipline of statistics, working on a project analysing LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) geochemical data from pyrite sections under the supervision of Associate Professor Andrew Metcalfe. At the same time (also in 2011) I started teaching at the University of Adelaide: tutoring, marking, and demonstrating through the School of Mathematical Sciences, and also through the Maths Learning Centre --- where I developed a love for helping people find the joy in mathematics. Together with Dr. David Butler and a few other people we coined a term for this, ``mathefreude'', which we later discovered is actually already a word (which is awesome, by the way). Working in the Maths Learning Centre is also when the seeds where first planted that would later grow into my passion for teaching, although I don't think I was fully aware of that at the time.</p> 
  
  <p>In 2012 I continued my trajectory into academia, beginning my PhD project on [``the statistical analysis of proteomics imaging mass spectrometry data''](https://github.com/Armadilloa16/thesis/blob/master/whole_thesis.pdf) under the supervision of Associate Professor Inge Koch, which I worked on until it was accepted for the degree in 2016. During that time interspersed between my PhD candidature I worked as a research assistant, but also continued teaching. I eventually dropped the teaching work through the School of Mathematical Sciences, but continuing to work at the Maths Learning Centre throughout.</p>

  <p> After I completed my PhD I continued working in the field as a postdoctoral research assistant for over a year (including all of 2017). At the beginning of 2017 I was asked to take on a full time research position at the University of Adelaide, which I initially accepted, but as a consequence I had to give up on teaching through the Maths Learning Centre. It was during this time that I realised the importance teaching had grown to have for me. I was unhappy in academia and I missed teaching. I starting going into the Maths Learning Centre and helping students there in my free time, on my lunch breaks and so on. It was then that I realised... if there is a job that I enjoy so much that I would volunteer to go and do it in my free time... that is probably what I should be doing with my life. Even having this realisation, changing direction is difficult, careers seem to have momentum and they pull you along with them. Initially I only took a half-step towards teaching, asking to go down to a part-time load of research so that I could start teaching again because of my realisation of its importance to me. This satisfied me for a time, but when my research funding ran out at the end of 2017 I realised it was an opportunity to focus all my time and efforts on my passion, and so I enrolled in the Master of Teaching program. </p>

  <h1 id="influences">Influences and Hobbies</h1>
  
  <img src="files/photos/shedidit.jpg" alt="Shedidit" hspace="20" style="float:left;width:240px">

  <p>Along the way I have been inspired by many people. Dan Kortchak inspired me to think about problems from the perspective of a systems or software engineer and not just that of a mathematician. The writing of Paul Halmos, first recommended to me by my PhD supervisor Inge, inspired me to be a better communicator with it's concise eloquence. But most of all the enthusiasm and pedagogy of David Butler's teaching practice at the Maths Learning Centre truely inspired me to be a better teacher.</p>

  <p>Brendan Bentley once said in the first intensive week of my Master of Teaching program, "Don't Assume", and that hit a powerful chord with me, reflecting my view on the importance of behaviour and the use of language in creating welcoming environments. In context, he was pointing out that when a student shows up late or falls asleep in class, you don't know what they have been through --- maybe their mum is sick in the hospital and they where up all night caring for her, you have no idea what they've been through. Don't Assume. That resonated with me.</p>

  <p>I have made <a href="files/qualifications/cv/cv.pdf">a neatly formatted one-page CV</a> for reference. This was compiled using LaTeX and <a href="files/qualifications/cv/cv.tex">the source file</a>, as well as <a href="files/qualifications/cv/res.cls">the style file</a> (which I just found on the internet), are also available. What follows is a more detailed resume, if that interests you.</p>
