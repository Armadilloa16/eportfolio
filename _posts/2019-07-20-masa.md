I attended the MASA 2019 mathematics teacher conference, and co-presented a workshop on SQWIGLES with David Butler, Jono Hage, and Jono Pantelis.

I also attended several other sessions, and I include some highlight and useful resources here:
- I attended two of John Rowe's presentations, in the first he spoke about his book "Hook Line Sinker", which I hadn't heard about before and seems like [an excellent resource]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/PD/MASA_19/hook_line_sinker.epub). In his second presentation he spoke about Desmos and running classes using it, and refered to [his website](https://mrrowe.com/), where his book is available but also alot of other useful resources.
- I also attended Amie Albrecht's presentation in which she spoke about the course she runs for teaching mathematics through problem solving for pre-service teachers, and the importance of struggle, recognising and showing incomplete work and general strategies. She refered to a couple of good books on the topic I should look up at some point.
- On Day 2 Mike Clapper presented a plenary on competition mathematics problem solving [contained some nice problems]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/PD/MASA_19/Plenary_Competition_Problem_Solving.pptx).
- I also attended two of David Butlers other presentations, and his "The goal is not the goal, the end is not the end" really resonated with me, [his prezi on the topic is here](prezi.com/4sw1qsnbcmkc). In his second presentation, on problem solving, I found the list of "It is always ok too" rules a very nice summary of some things I have wanted to say so I include [John Rowe's tweet on the topic](https://twitter.com/MrJohnRowe/status/1152089798368088064) for later reference.
