Accessibility, Relevance, Suitability
========================================================
- Accessibility: Caltech holds the rights, but the lectures are freely available to [read online](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/).
- Relevance: Aren't these lectures on Physics? Volume I, Chapter 1: "Atoms in Motion" is actually mostly about Chemistry.
- Suitability: The material in Chapter 1 could be used directly, I think it would be most suitable for SIS but there is also some SU relevant to SACE.
- Suitability: However I think the best use of this resource would be as an exemplar of thoughtful, concise, and eloquent teaching (writing), and I would use it as inspiration for style and design of my own content.

Application
========================================================
An example: Feynman includes caveats with his figures and explanations, [Chapter 1](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_01.html) includes some nice examples of this that could either be used vertbatim or used as inspiration for doing something similar:
- Figures 1-1 and 1-2 are cute examples of accurate details being included helping understanding.
- Figure 1-7 is a nice example of how to introduce a new idea through such caveats.

Application
========================================================
Another example: "the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment":
- Particularly if students are interested in history, could have a discovery project for them to research Feynman, could have them read my favorite quote from [Chapter 2](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_02.html). 
- One could design a SIS activity around the concept discussed above --- challenging the fundamental assumptions of science.
