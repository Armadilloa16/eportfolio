I watched the ATSIMA webinar today. The first speaker, Amber, spoke about her research and about policy and the dead white guy domination of the perception of mathematics. 

The second speaker, Rowena Ball, shared a number of activities. 
 - Playing rugby on the mooon.
 - The DaVinci bridge construction activity was pretty cool.
 - Chirality activity 
 - Fractals, Norman River, making fractals from cardboard.
 All are quite practical, hands-on, storytelling-based activities. "Gulf Geeks" facebook group.
