For Supportive and Safe Learning Environments (SSLE) we each had to nominate a topic to present to the rest of the class. I nominated to present LBGTQIA+, and presented with Betula. It went pretty well, [here are the slides we prepared](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VDCoVxXEHwSR8H4O0UguA9IHsNb-zi4jn_s2cqHDaQE/edit?usp=sharing), with additional notes and resources in comments.

I didn't think the rest of the assignments I did for SSLE were particularly useful or relevant to be uploaded to my e-portfolio.
