This is a personal statement I wrote after the completion of my teaching practicum experience through the Master of Teaching program, which I wrote to include more specific examples of my teaching practice and organised under the three main APST headings.

## Professional Knowledge
  
  Central to my teaching ideology is that each student has individual learning needs, and that the best most practical way to address these is use student voice and student driven content to inform my teaching. I build relationships and rapport with students through one-on-one conversations to create an environment in which they feel safe and comfortable communicating with me honestly. This allows for ongoing informal formative assessment of their learning, which I use to differentiate and adjust my teaching to their needs. I offer choices to my students in my classrooms as much as possible, as this offers them opportunities to differentiate their own learning by choosing an option more beneficial to them as individuals. For example in my year 10 mathematics class I have in the past offered the students a choice between a closed book and an open book test, or offered them the choice between individual and group work tasks. 
  
  I beleive that when students make choices about their own learning, they become more invested in it and thereby get more out of it. To this end I encourage students to take an active role in shaping their learning in our shared classrooms. In practice this takes many different forms: students asking for me to speed up or slow down as we go through subject matter, students engaging is self-directed investigations, to customisation of the physical and social environment through negotiation and guided self-reflection. The depth of my knowledge in mathematics and the sciences allows me to easily extend students well beyond their year level (or even beyond school level curriculum as appropriate), give context to the learning by placing it in an authentic framework, and my experience working at the maths learning centre has led to me learning many differnt ways to explain the same concepts, which can be a very valuble ability when students are struggling to understand something. Beyond simple extension and alterative explanations of concepts, my experience in mathematics and science also allow me to guide students on self-directed investigations of great depth, which I thoroughly enjoy. For example, if doing a practical in science and students suggest changing the experimental design in some way, I will guide them to make adjustments that make sense, and do everything in my power to support this happening. Sometimes this can be simple, for example once when conducting an experiment involving bouncing balls and measuring the height to which diffent types of balls bounce, one student asked if they could try inflating a soccerball to see if the height to which it bounced changed when inflated. So before the next leson I went to the PE faculty and borrowed a soccerball and pump to inflate it. 

  
  
## Professional Practice</h2>
      
  Central to my teaching ideology is to recognise each individual students unique strengths, and to encourage the development of relationships based on mutual respect of each others unique strengths. In my practice I always look out for unique learning opportunities to encourage student participation. For example, in my year 10 science class at NMHS I introduced a summative practical: to bounce balls in an investigation of the law of conservation of energy. When first introducing the class I left determination of the independent variables for the experiment deliberately vague, and instructed the students to come up with some on their own instead of giving them the scaffolding document in which it was suggested that different types of balls be used and dropped from different heights as the two independent variables. Some students struggled, and for those I had some copies of the scaffolding document on hand to help them along, but introducing the task in this way gave other students the opportunities to suggest different variables, not suggested in the scaffolding document. One student in particular came up with the idea of using a slightly deflated beachball or soccerball, and then inflating it to see the difference inflation made. This was particularly notable because this student had not been particularly engaged in class, and had had middling academic success in the previous term showing consistent disinterest in class up until this point. But when I came to the next class with a pump, ready to test their idea they immediately engaged with the task, was completely self-driven, and produced an excellent prac report to describe it. Allowing students to engage with material and make it their own can engage students that might otherwise be disinterested and this was one of the most valuable memories I took from practicum. Using open ended questions in this way to engage students in work by giving them a degree of ownership over it is one of my favoured techniques, as it also allows students to self-asses and determine their own problem to solve to a degree, and so the difficulty of the problem is also partly in their control. Another example of my using this technique was in my year 10 mathematics class at BHS, I offered a two-stage choice for the assessment of the indices unit: first, students could sit either a fairly standard test, or they could choose to attempt a more open-ended directed investigation. Second, in the investigation the final section involved them constructing their own problem to solve, and so they could determine their own difficulty level --- some chose to construct a problem that was easy to solve (which is a high-level thinking skill in and of itself), others chose to challenge themselves and deliberately constructed a problem that was difficult to solve. Giving the students choice in this way allowed the students to tailor their own learning experience, and choose assessment in this case that was more inline with their own learning styles and preferences.
  
  For students to learn and excel they need to feel comfortable and safe. As such, an affective approach to student wellbeing is crucial. By producing an environment in which students can feel safe, I can help them to discover their strengths and excel. I do this primarily by building relationships with my students. This is a subtle process that takes some time, but gradually trust is developed and through that I can gain some insight into how my students are feeling and make adjustments to the classroom environment in order to help them feel more comfortable. For example, in one of my classes I ran an activity in which I taught the class how to fold A4 paper into silver rhombic dodecahedra and had them investigate the properties of this shape. The process of folding the paper is quite therapeutic, and as I ran this activity after already having had the class for a few weeks and having established relationships with them enough that they felt comfortable coming up to me and telling about their feelings, one student came up to me after class and admitted that she had been suffering from severe anxiety and that had been the reason that she had missed alot of classes but that folding the paper rhombic units had actually helped her feel a lot more comfortable in class. As a result I modified the classroom environment the next week by putting a stack of paper in the corner of the class and informing the class that if anyone was feeling overwhelmed or anxious during class that they could move over into the corner and fold some rhombic units for dodecahedra as a calming exercise. Several students beyond the original one who had come to talk to me took advantage of this corner in the weeks to follow, and several of them told me about how it had helped them calm down after having had some pretty severely traumatic events outside of the class. Some of these students attendance rates also improved after this. Its in ways like this that I aim to create a safe environment in which my students can feel comfortable and productive. If students are in an uncomfortable environment or feel unsafe it is completely unreasonable to expect them to be able to learn, so as teachers providing a safe environment for our students has to be one of our highest priorities, not just because without that it would be impossible for our students to learn, but because everybody deserves to feel safe. It is literally in the international bill of human rights.

## Professional Engagement
  
  Learning is a passion of mine, and I have never stopped learning at any point during my life. Through discussion with colleagues and self-reflection I identify my weaknesses and areas of ignorance, and constantly work to better myself and improve. I particularly benefit from open discussions with colleagues who hold very different views/ beliefs and use very different teaching methods to me, as this is when I learn the most. For example on my placement to BHS, one of my mentor teachers had a very different teaching style to mine. Through discussions with her and with the students I gained alot of insight into how there truely is no single best teaching style, there is simply teaching styles that better suit certain students, and teaching styles that better suit different teachers. I learnt that there is alot of value in learning from teachers with different teaching styles than your own, because pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone and learning these different skills can be incredibly valuable with faced with students who do not respond to your preferred style. Professional development is always a pleasure for me, and while I was at BHS and they had a numeracy focused professional development day I offered to take a workshop on probabiltiy and share my expertise with the rest of the staff. I even had one staff member approach me several days later and thank me, because she had apparently suffered from severe maths anxiety, having a minor panic attack on the morning of the PD day because she realised it would have a numeracy focus, but she said that the workshop I ran had opened her eyes to the possibility that maths might not actually be all that scary and more connected to concepts with which she felt comfortable than she had previously realised. I was very proud of her, and I only wish I could bring experiences like that to more people.
