We where set [a task]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/classroomSafety/ChemistryCMOrganicPreparationClassroomManagement&Safety18.pdf) to do a risk assessment, either using the given [risk assessment tool]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/classroomSafety/RiskAssessmentProforma18.pdf) or through the riskAssess online portal (reccommended), and to reflect on how we would manage risk in a given [ester hydrolysis practical]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/classroomSafety/Stg2ChemInvestigationsFolioEsterHydrolysis18.pdf).

Here is [the risk assessment I did]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/classroomSafety/ester-hydrolysis.pdf) through the riskAssess portal, and here is [my reflection]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/classroomSafety/Reflection.docx) on managing classroom safety.
