I've been meaning to learn how to use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build websites for awhile, and when the first task for the ICT component in the Master of Teaching program was to construct an e-portfolio, I knew I had put it off long enough. So after some fiddling with getting the right versions of ruby and the gem dependancies installed and some learning-the-hard-way of some of the ins and outs of jekyll, I have a basic draft online! It is hosted on GitHub Pages, I've uploaded some placeholders for a photo and Personal Statement for the time being, and populated the APST Standards table with the default values taken from the google sites template. I also set up a blog for the reflections, and I'm planning to use categories to seperate out blog posts (or `reflections') for various subjects (Curriculum and Methodology Core Course Seminar Reflections, for example). The source is available from [my GitHub](https://github.com/Armadilloa16/eportfolio).

Having an e-portfolio contributes towards [APST]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link apst.html %}) 2.6, 3.4 and 4.5 while learning how to use jekyll and program the website from scratch constitutes personal development (6.2).
