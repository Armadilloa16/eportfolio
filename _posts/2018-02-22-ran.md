Today I completed the Responding to Abuse and Neglect (RAN) course, through the [Australian Education Union](https://www.aeusa.asn.au/). 
At the end of the day I got [my certificate of qualification]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/qualifications/RAN.pdf). 

It was intense. We talked about what abuse and neglect looks like, and our responsibilities as teachers (and just responsible human adults) to notice the signs and report on it. It was... a draining day of training, to say the least.



TODO: I should add links to APST Standards to this...
