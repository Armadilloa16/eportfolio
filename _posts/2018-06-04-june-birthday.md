Today, on my first official day of placement, one of the students in my mentor teachers PLG class had a birthday, so some of her friends asked to come in early and prepare the whiteboard for her birthday surprise in first period (see photo below), which was accompanied by (delicious) cheesecake also made by some of the other students.
