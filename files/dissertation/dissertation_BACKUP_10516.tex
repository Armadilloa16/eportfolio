University mathematics bridging courses serve an important stop-gap role in the Australian educational system, and other educational systems internationally.

This project can be thought of as consisting of two broad categories of work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A literature review of Australian mathematics bridging courses, a state of the field of research in this area, and commentary on the role, purpose, and approaches important to implementing effective and impactful mathematics bridging courses in Australia and internationally.
	\item Reflection on the  mathematics bridging courses offered by the University of Adelaide: MathsStart and MathsTrack with a focus on existing strengths, and directions for potential improvement. This will be broken into two sub-sections of work, with one of the bigger contributions I offer being a curriculum mapping from the \gls{ac} to \gls{sace} through to MathsStart and MathsTrack. This curriculum mapping suggests potential areas for modification of the mathematics bridging courses to more closely align them with the \gls{ac} and \gls{sace}. The second sub-section of work will be on the non-content aspects of the bridging courses (structure, assessment, timing, feedback, etc.), the strenghts of their approaches in comparison to others, potential weaknesses, and reccomendations moving forward both for MathsStart and MathsTrack, and for university mathematics bridging courses more broadly.
\end{itemize}

This thesis will be structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The remainder of this introductory chapter (\refchap{intro}), I will give a broad overview of the concepts, challenges, and setting for this project.
	\item In \refchap{literature} I will provide a indepth discussion of the existing literature, what is known, approaches attempted in the past both in Australia and internationally, and some deeper discssion on some of the particularly relevant related concepts, such as maths anxiety.
	\item One of the major contributions of this work is the curriculum mapping of the \gls{ac} to \gls{sace}, to the content currently in MathsStart and MathsTrack, with commentary on how this mapping connects with typical first-year university mathematics courses. This mapping is discussed in \refchap{curriculum}, and will identify gaps and mis-alignment, discuss the tension between different perspectives on the role of university mathematics bridging courses and how this impacts on content decisions, and potential modifications to the bridging courses content that would allow them to be more closely aligned with the \gls{ac} should that be desirable.
	\item Finally, I will wrap up with commentary on what is being done well, reccomendations for how to improve, and a summary of the work I have done outside of this thesis to generate resources and content that can be used to improve these programs moving forward in \refchap{recommendations}.
\end{itemize}



\section{The Role of University Mathematics Bridging Courses}

Students will usually enroll in university mathematics bridging courses because they are required to demonstrate a certain level of mathematical knowledge/ competance before commencing study at university, but either do not meet those requirements, or do but feel a lack of confidence in their abilites and feel like they need to refresh/ revise/ learn the mathematics prior to commencing their studies.

Many of these students will be adult-entry students, and reasons why these students do not either meet the entry requirements, or feel a lack of confidence in their abilities can be quite varied:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A long period of time may have passed since they last studied mathematics (or studied at all).
	\item They may have performed poorly in mathematics in highschool.
	\item They may have chosen not to study mathematics at a higher level in highschool.
	\item They may suffer from maths anxiety (which would make them likely to fit into the above two categories as well).
\end{itemize}
	
The role of mathematics bridging courses is to take these students, and:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bridge their content knowledge so they are prepared for university entry.
	\item Support the growth of their confidence and self-efficacy surrounding mathematics.
	\item Ultimately prepare them to be successful in a university context.
\end{itemize}

From the perspective of content, what content should be taught in a university bridging course is actually a question that has dramatically different answers from different perspectives on the role of such a course:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If you take the perspective that the role of such a course is to fill in the gaps in student's knowledge left from an incomplete or maths-light highschool education, then the content that should be taught should be up to and including the advanced year 12 australian curriculum. This is particularly appropriate if you do not know the direction of the students, or if they are potentially just doing the bridging course with you and they are planning on studying a degree at a different university say, interstate.
	\item If you take the perspective that the role of such a course is to prepare students for entry into the particular courses they are about to commence studying, the content relevant to them will be dramatically differnet. The senior mathematics australian curriculum is extremely generalist and contains many topics that would be completely irrelevant to any particular field of study. 
\end{itemize}
In terms of choosing what content to teach in a university bridging course, the above two competing perspectives will often be at odds with each other.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{Gordon2013} describes the perspectives of students enrolled in an Australian university bridging course.
	\item \cite{Johnson2016} describes the impact of a bridging course on students maths anxiety and self-efficacy in Ireland.

	\item \cite{Nicholas2015} is very relevant but I can't find the actual paper, just references too it.
\end{itemize}




\section{Maths Anxiety}


\subsection*{Why is Maths Anxiety Important?}

Maths anxiety is hugely prevalent, the 2012 \gls{pisa} report states that across \gls{oecd} countries, over 30\% of 15 year old students ``get very nervous doing mathematics problems'', and over 60\% of students ``worry about getting poor grades in mathematics''  \cite{PISA2013}. As teachers our foremost concern should be for the wellbeing of our students. It has been shown that students with a high level of maths anxiety often literally experience the anticipation of a maths task as visceral pain \cite{Lyons2012pain}. There is a clear and overwhelming moral imperative (and ethical duty of care) on us to do everything in our power to protect students in our care from maths anxiety.

Even if the wellbeing issue was not enough, there is also a clear maths anxiety-performance connection, and all the stakeholders in a students academic success in maths. One example of this is highlighted by \citeA{Foley2017} who juxtaposes the internationally rising demand for \gls{stem} professionals with the negative correlation between maths anxiety and performance shown in the 2012 \gls{pisa} report \cite{PISA2013} to highlight the relevance of addressing maths anxiety in filling this demand. The relationship between maths anxiety and maths-qualified professionals in the workforce is supported throughout the literature: when a student has low self-concept (correlated with high maths anxiety), they will tend not to enroll in maths beyond the minimum requirements for graduation \cite{Ashcraft2007book}, and students affect towards maths can predict their university major \cite{LeFevre1992}. Beyond this example, the list of stakeholders in a students academic success in maths goes on and on: parents; the student's themselves; schools (which are often funded based on the results of standardised testing such as \gls{naplan}), and teachers amongst them. 


\subsection*{Maths Anxiety as Distinct from General Anxiety}

The existence of maths anxiety as ``emotional disturbances in the presence of mathematics'' has been noted as early as the 1950's, \citeA{Dreger1957} even postulated that what he tentatively designated ``Number Anxiety'' and later became to be known as Maths Anxiety could be a distinct syndrome from general anxiety. Later the landmark meta-study of \citeA{Hembree1990} supported this hypothesis, showing a correlation of only $0.38$ between maths anxiety and general anxiety. In more recent times, this hypothesis has also been confirmed by \citeA{Young2012} using \gls{fmri} to show that the brain activity in a person experiencing maths anxiety is measurably distinct from that in a person suffering general anxiety. These later studies, as well as the the work of \citeA{Kazelskis2000} and more, have also delineated maths anxiety from test anxiety, and these different anxieties exisitng as meaningfully distinct constructs is now quite well accepted. For more on the history of maths anxiety, \citeA{Pellicioni2016} offers a more detailed review.


\subsection*{Frameworks for Understanding Maths Anxiety}.

Only a few studies focus on maths anxiety itself (primarily \gls{fmri} studies such as those of  \citeA{Young2012} or \citeA{Lyons2012pain}). Instead the bulk of the literature is focused on the maths anxiety-performance link.  Specifically, there seem to be two distinct theories being pursued and I will adopt the terminology of \citeA{Ramirez2018} to describe them: the ``Disruption Account'' and the ``Reduced Competency Account''. \citeA{Ramirez2018} go on to make a convincing argument that although these two theories might seem to compete, they are not actually mutually exclusive and instead quite compatible with each other. \citeA{Ramirez2018} suggests a third ``Interpretation Account'' which encapsulates observations made by both lines of research, see \reffig{ramirez}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\input{./figures/ramirez_interpretation_account}
\caption{The Interpretation Account of Ramirez et al. (2018) for the maths anxiety-performance link showing how the Disruption Account and the Reduced Competency Account can be compatible.
\label{fig:ramirez}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

First, a little more detail on the existing theories. The ``Disruption Account'', spearheaded by the work of Ashcraft et al., is centered around the concept of working memory \cite{Ashcraft2001, Ashcraft2007}. Specifically that anxiety about maths takes up students working memory, which prevents them from using that working memory to complete maths tasks and thereby impacts their performance. The ``Reduced Competency Account'' on the other hand proposes the opposite causality: that lower ability in maths leads to negative experiences associated to maths, which in turn cause maths anxiety to develop. There is also a significant body of work to support this hypothesis, including the milestone meta-analysis of \citeA{Hembree1990} and the longitudinal study of \citeA{Ma2004} which found that although past maths anxiety was correlated with future maths performance it was a small effect, while past maths performance had a strong effect on future maths anxiety.



\subsection*{Complexities in Finding Effective Interventions}

These theoretical views are of course broad oversimplifications of what is an incredibly complex and interconnected topic. They also imply very different approaches for intervention. The ``Reduced Competency Account'' would imply interventions to boost maths performance and hence allow students to experience success in math should also help to reduce maths anxiety. The results of  \citeA{Supekar2015} seem to support this hypothesis as when students are given an intensive 8-week tutoring program to boost their maths skills, this is associated to a reduction in maths anxiety. The earlier work by \citeA{Faust1996} further supports this by demonstrating an anxiety-complexity effect in which low and high maths anxiety groups performed similarly on low complexity problems, but in high complexity problems the high anxiety groups performance was impacted. On the other hand, \citeA{Jansen2013} showed that it is not neccessarily that simple, by showing that when students experience more success they attempt more problems and perform better. However their improved performance is almost completely predicted by the number of problems they attempted, not their experience of success, and their level of maths anxiety was not affected in a significant way which raises a lot of interesting but unanswered questions about this approach. 
	
On the other side of attempted interventions are those in line with the ``Disruption Account'', in which the maths anxiety itself is addressed in the hopes that will free up extra working memory and hence boost students performance.  \citeA{Park2014} demonstrate a direct and successful attempt at this in which they used expressive writing exercises to help guide students self-perceived narratives about their maths experiences and thereby reduce their maths anxiety. Notably the approach of \citeA{Park2014} is in line with successful treatments for clinical anxiety disorders (see \citeA{McNally2007, Becker2007,Foa2005}). Another approach that has shown success in this vein does not attempt to directly reduce the anxiety experienced, but rather reappraise it's symptoms \cite{Jamieson2016}. This is another technique from clinical psychology in which stress is reconceptualised as a coping tool, an evolutionary method for heightening performance in response to a challenge to be overcome, instead of a symptom of exposure to something to be feared and avoided. This change in the perspective of stress is also very much in line with the ``Interpretation Account'' of \citeA{Ramirez2018}.

The work of \citeA{Wang2015} showed the role that intrinsic motivation has mediating the relationship between maths anxiety and performance, and suggested the importance of a mindset centred on viewing the process of learning maths as one of ``productive struggle''. This reconceptualisation to a `productive struggle' model is supported by other literature as well, \citeA{Lin-Siegler2016} exposes students in a classroom to struggles experienced by famous scientists in order to help normalise the concept of productive struggle, and \citeA{Hiebert2007} discuss the importance of this same concept in a maths context.

One of the implications of the ``Interpretation Account'' is that if an intervention targets only one of these two possible links in the cycle (see \reffig{ramirez}), the cycle may re-establish itself after the intervention is over and negate any potential longterm effects. However there is only a very limited amount of research out there on such longterm effects, and several authors have discussed the need for further research into this \cite{Pellicioni2016,Chang2016}. My hypothesis is that a multi-faceted approach targetting both directions simultaneously could disrupt the cycle shown in \reffig{ramirez} and result in significant longterm effects.

\subsection*{Instruments for Measuring Maths Anxiety}

In order to track the effectiveness of these interventions, we will be collating assessment results as a measure of performance, but will also want to measure maths anxiety and maths affect/ self-concept. Significant work has been done over the years to develop psychometrics to measure maths anxiety, almost exclusively consisting of self-reporting surveys (with the exception of some more modern \gls{fmri} work, such as that of \citeA{Lyons2012}). We will use a recently developed scale: the \gls{mas-r} of \citeA{Bai2009}, which has been shown to be remarkably self consistent by incorporating both positive and negative affect items \cite{Bai2011}. It is short, easy to implement, and cheap in comparison to \gls{fmri} methods. In order to measure maths self-concept, \citeA{Jansen2013} modified the Perceived Competence Scale for Children of \citeA{Harter1982} to measure ``Math Competance''. The methodological process imployed by \citeA{Jansen2013} was quite rigorous and so we will use their instrument, or a minor modification thereof (we will do it in English), to measure maths self-concept.

\chapter{Curriculum Mapping}
\label{chap:curriculum}

<<<<<<< HEAD
One of the important roles of university mathematics bridging courses (such as MathsStart and MathsTrack) is to fill the content knowledge gap for students who did not complete mathematics to a sufficiently high level in highschool, or completed it long enough ago that they need to re-learn the material, but wish to commence study at a university level in subjects that have a high level of required knowledge in mathematics. 

Although the \gls{ac} lays out the expected curriculum for senior highschool (years 11 and 12), the exact content knowledge expected of students having completed highschool in Australia varies for a number of reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To begin with, the \gls{ac} specifies four levels of mathematics: essential mathematics, general mathematics, mathematical methods, and specialist mathematics. Our focus will be on the higher two of these: mathematical methods and specialist mathematics, as these are the ones often associated to university entry into mathematics-intensive courses. 
	\item 
\end{itemize}

required varies dramatically depending on the university course. Beyond this, different states in Australia teach different curriculums in senior highschool, and some differ significantly from the \gls{ac}, some do not even use the terms ``Mathematical Methods'' and ``Specialist Mathematics'' at all. In South Australia we teach the \gls{sace}, and so the expected knowledge when entrying South Australian unviersities tends to be based on the \gls{sace} curriculum. A notable example of this was in 2018 when significant changes where made to the \gls{sace} senior mathematics curriculum, the University of Adelaide re-modelled the content in it's primary first year mathematics courses to better match the prior knowledge of the majority of new students coming from \gls{sace}. That said, it is still of interest to align the bridging courses with not only the \gls{sace} curriculum, but also with \gls{ac} as students enrolling in the bridging courses are not always intending to commence study in south australia. For example, students planning to commence study in a university interstate in the following year but currently living in south australia may be reccomended to the bridging courses by the university they are planning to go too.

This chapter will examine the alignment of the content of MathsStart and MathsTrack (the mathematics bridging courses offered at the university of adelaide) with the \gls{ac} and \gls{sace}. First, in \refsec{content}, some notation will be introduced and the content of each of the three curriculums will be reviewed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \gls{ac} senior mathematics subjects mathematical methods and specialist mathematics,
	\item The \gls{sace} curriculum stage 1 mathematics, stage 2 mathematical methods, and stage 2 specialist mathematics,
	\item The University of Adelaide's bridging courses: MathsStart, and MathsTrack.
\end{itemize}
Then, these will be mapped to each other in \refsec{mapping} (see \reffig{mapping}).
Throughout, discussion will be had around alignment and gaps between the content of these curriculums and courses, explanations and reasons for these discrepancies, and potential alternate approaches. 

Beyond that, this chapter will also briefly discuss the alignment of these bridging courses to first year university mathematics courses and bridging courses offered by other universities in Australia, and discuss the relationship between the gaps in alignment between the \gls{ac}/\gls{sace} and the bridging courses and the requirements of these first year university courses. 

%However, overall the focus is on the alignment of the bridging courses and \gls{ac}/ \gls{sace}, rather than their alignment to the first year university courses for one clear and important reason: not all students enrolling in these bridging courses are commencing these first year university courses, or may be doing so at a different university in which their first year content is different. Hence, it is most fair to attempt to align the content with the \gls{ac}/\gls{sace} as this is the content other students should be covering in highschool prior to enrolling in university in any case, and hence puts people at a fair standing with those students, and also being aligned with the \gls{ac} in particular is useful for guaranteeing a certain level of knowledge for enrollment in universities interstate. 

\section{Content}
\label{sec:content}

\subsection{Notation}

Each of the senior highschool curriculums, as well as the university bridging courses, being considered here is broken down into topics, with each topic containing a number of key concepts. In \refsec{mapping}, the alignment between these curriculums and bridging courses will be considered thoroughly at both a topic-level, and to the finer detail of particular key concepts. In order to abstract away some of the complexity of considering the topic-level alignment, and be able to present the topic-level alignment in a meaningful way abbreviated codes will be used to identify each topic. These abbreviated codes are presented in \reftab{notation} and will be used for the remainder of this chapter.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Abbreviated codes for topics within the \gls{ac} and \gls{sace} senior mathematics subjects: Mathematical Methods nd Specialist Mathematics, as well as the Unviersity of Adelaides bridging courses: MathsStart and MathsTrack. Square brackets ([]) are used to indicate numeric values that can vary. \label{tab:notation}}
\begin{tabular}{ll}

MT[\#] & Maths Track, Topic (Booklet) [\#]
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Within-Topic Key Concepts}

Description of each topic in the \gls{ac} Mathematical Methods and Specialist Mathematics Topics, \gls{sace} stage 1 mathematics, stage 2 mathematical methods and stage 2 specialist mathematics, and the University of Adelaides MathsStart and MathsTrack programs. For brevity a code is used to identify each topic, see \reftab{notation} above, and then for each topic it's name is given in bold followed by a list of the key concepts covered in that topic. These are discussed at length below, and this table is intended to be used as reference material for that discussion.

Note: I generally omit ``interpretation'' concepts. For example in S1M2 on quadratics I include the key concepts around the Vertex Form and Factorised Form, but I do not include the interpretation fo roots and vertices, deducing these from the equation of a quadratic, or deducing the equation of a quadratic given these bits of information. These are more surrounding skills, which I think it is fair to assume should be taught along with the key concepts. To an experienced maths educator, the key concepts should be enough to deduce the required surrounding interpretative framework. 

Note: This is a huge table. I could maybe put it in an apprendix?

	\item MT2: Gauss-Jordan is used to introduce the concept of a Matrix Inverse, altough very relevant to first year maths, not in the AC/ SACE at all .
	\item MT6: Note that the concept of the normal to a curve is introduced, but is not in any curriculum (or first year maths course that I know of?)
	\item MT8: There are many ways to introduce $e = 2.718\hdots$, but the way it is introduced in MathsTrack is (perhaps coincidentally), precisely the same as the way it is introduced in SACE (and AC?).
	\item MT8: Surge Models are introduced which are not used anywhere else.
	\item MT8: Logistic Models are introduced, but not as a DE just as a model.

\section{Curriculum Mapping}
\label{sec:mapping}

\reffig{mapping} shows the topic-level alignment between the \gls{ac} (senior mathematical methods and specialist mathematics), \gls{sace} (mathematical methods and specialist mathematics), MathsStart and MathsTrack. Although sub-topic alignment within these topic alignments is not always perfect, it is fairly strong in each case but individual cases will be discussed in more detail below.

With respect to the bridging courses run through the university of adelaide's maths learning centre: MathsStart and MathsTrack,
\begin{itemize}
	\item The self-paced and feedback focused approach to assessment is certainly the highlight of the programs, should be continued, encouraged, potentially further resourced, expanded, and reccomended to other bridging course facilitators.
	\item The role of bridging courses as what is often student's first experience at university implies that potentially students wellbeing and retention could be improved by structuring the programs to provide more opportunities for students to meet each other and work together: either in the maths learning center drop-in area, or a seperate area, but potentially assigning a certain time on a certain day perhaps weekly or fortnightly during which students are encouraged to come and work together, could allow them to make freinds, build social networks, and better aclimitise them to the university environment in order to better prepare them for success in their studies.
	\item The smallest but perhaps easiest to implement improvement could be to better align the course content with curriculum, both the highschool curriculum (\gls{ac}/ \gls{sace}) in the case of students doing the bridging course to then comence study interstate or overseas, or with specific first year entry level courses, to better match the potential gaps in knowledge students may encounter.
