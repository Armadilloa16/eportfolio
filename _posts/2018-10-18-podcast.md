For professional engagement, our first assignment was to introduce ourselves with a podcast and answer a few questions related to our strengths, weaknesses, and the APST. I thought I would put the [link to the unlisted youTube video I submitted](https://youtu.be/wisY03sOamM) here for posterity.

I didn't think the rest of the assignments I did for Professional Engagement were particularly useful or relevant to be uploaded to my e-portfolio.
