We were tasked to make a lesson plan and collate/ create all the required teaching resources for a SACE mathematics subject. [Instructions and rubric]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/mathLessonPlan/MathsLessonPlan.pdf) as well as a [lesson plan template]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/mathLessonPlan/MathsLessonPlanTemplate.docx) were provided.

My [completed lesson plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/mathLessonPlan/MathsLessonPlan.docx) contains links to most of the resources, with the exception of the [worksheet intended to be a physical handout]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/mathLessonPlan/worksheet.pdf).

The main other resources that are linked in my completed lesson plan include [a GeoGebra worksheet](https://ggbm.at/kpREkaRQ), and [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/zUL2OBqF-qQ) I made for [a previous task]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-16-quadrilaterals-video %}).
