As a component of the "Research Design" component of the Master of Teaching program I wrote a research proposal, consisting mostly of a literature review. I chose to do it on Maths Anxiety. Both the [compiled pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/dissertation/proposal/research_proposal.pdf) and [source .tex]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/dissertation/proposal/research_proposal.tex) of the final version are available.
