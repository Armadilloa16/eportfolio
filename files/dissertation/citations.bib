abstract = { Math anxiety is a negative emotional reaction to situations involving mathematical problem solving. Math anxiety has a detrimental impact on an individual’s long-term professional success, but its neurodevelopmental origins are unknown. In a functional MRI study on 7- to 9-year-old children, we showed that math anxiety was associated with hyperactivity in right amygdala regions that are important for processing negative emotions. In addition, we found that math anxiety was associated with reduced activity in posterior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions involved in mathematical reasoning. Multivariate classification analysis revealed distinct multivoxel activity patterns, which were independent of overall activation levels in the right amygdala. Furthermore, effective connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions that regulate negative emotions was elevated in children with math anxiety. These effects were specific to math anxiety and unrelated to general anxiety, intelligence, working memory, or reading ability. Our study identified the neural correlates of math anxiety for the first time, and our findings have significant implications for its early identification and treatment. }

abstract = "It was investigated whether children would experience less math anxiety and feel more competent when they, independent of ability level, experienced high success rates in math. Comparable success rates were achieved by adapting problem difficulty to individuals' ability levels with a computer-adaptive program. A total of 207 children (grades 3–6) were distributed over a control and three experimental conditions in which they used the program for six weeks. Experimental conditions differed in pre-set success rate. Math anxiety, perceived math competence, and math performance were assessed before and after the practice period. Math anxiety scores improved equally in all conditions. Improvement on perceived math competence was modest. Math performance, however, only improved in the experimental conditions. Moreover, the higher the pre-set success rate, the more problems were attempted, and the larger the improvement in math performance, suggesting that success in math leads to more practice and thus to higher math performance."

An exploratory factor analysis on the scale yielded strong construct validity with a clear two-factor structure. The results from a confirmatory factor analysis indicated an excellent model-fit (χ 2 = 98.32, df = 62; normed fit index = .92, comparative fit index = .97; root mean square error of approximation = .04). The internal consistency (.85), test—retest reliability (.71), interfactor correlation (.26, p < .001), and positive discrimination power indicated that MAS-R is a psychometrically reliable and valid instrument for measuring mathematics anxiety. Math anxiety, as measured by MAS-R, correlated negatively with student achievement scores (r = -.38), suggesting that MAS-R may be a useful tool for classroom teachers and other educational personnel tasked with identifying students at risk of reduced math achievement because of anxiety. }

The current study investigated whether individual differences in emotional self-efficacy – confidence in one’s ability to regulate negative emotions – protected against anxiety-related impairments in a standardized math exam in a sample of elementary school youth (N=139). Results indicated that anxiety negatively predicted math test performance only for children with low levels of emotional self-efficacy. Students reporting high levels of emotional self-efficacy did not show anxiety-related decrements on the test performance. Emotional self-efficacy appears useful in managing negative effects of anxiety."

abstract = { Demand for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals is on the rise worldwide. To effectively meet this demand, many governments and private organizations have revamped STEM education and promoted training to enhance math and science skills among students and workers. Education and training programs typically focus on increasing individuals’ math and science knowledge. However, data from laboratory studies and large-scale international assessments suggest that fear or apprehension about math, math anxiety, should also be considered when trying to increase math achievement and, in turn, STEM career success. This article reviews findings that shed light on antecedents of math anxiety, the bidirectional math anxiety-performance relation, underlying mechanisms, and promising routes to mitigating the negative relation between math anxiety and math performance. }

It is important for healthcare students to overcome this barrier when calculating drug dosages in order to avoid administering the incorrect dose to a patient when in the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maths anxiety on healthcare students' ability to accurately calculate drug dosages by performing a scoping review of the existing literature. This review utilised a six-stage methodology using the following databases; CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Trip database (http://www.tripdatabase.com/) and Grey Literature report (http://www.greylit.org/). After an initial title/abstract review of relevant papers, and then full text review of the remaining papers, six articles were selected for inclusion in this study. Of the six articles included, there were three experimental studies, two quantitative studies and one mixed method study. All studies addressed nursing students and the presence of maths anxiety. No relevant studies from other disciplines were identified in the existing literature. Three studies took place in the U.S, the remainder in Canada, Australia and United Kingdom. Upon analysis of these studies, four factors including maths anxiety were identified as having an influence on a student's drug dosage calculation abilities. Ultimately, the results from this review suggest more research is required in nursing and other relevant healthcare disciplines regarding the effects of maths anxiety on drug dosage calculations. This additional knowledge will be important to further inform development of strategies to decrease the potentially serious effects of errors in drug dosage calculation to patient safety."

ABSTRACT={We review how stress induction, time pressure manipulations and math anxiety can interfere with or modulate selection of problem-solving strategies (henceforth “strategy selection”) in arithmetical tasks. 19 relevant articles were identified, which contain references to strategy selection and time limit (or time manipulations), with some also discussing emotional aspects in mathematical outcomes. Few of these take cognitive processes such as working memory or executive functions into consideration. We conclude that due to the sparsity of available literature our questions can only be partially answered and currently there is not much evidence of clear associations. We identify major gaps in knowledge and raise a series of open questions to guide further research.}

Given the considerable interest aroused by this topic in recent years and the growing number of publications related to it, the present article aims to provide a full and updated review of the field, ranging from the initial studies of the impact of math anxiety on numerical cognition, to the latest research exploring its electrophysiological correlates and brain bases from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Finally, this review describes the factors and mechanisms that have been claimed to play a role in the origins and/or maintenance of math anxiety, and it examines in detail the main explanations proposed to account for the negative effects of math anxiety on performance: competition for working memory resources, a deficit in a low-level numerical representation, and inhibition/attentional control deficit.",

Several interventions have recently been developed to alleviate the relation between math anxiety and math performance. To lower math anxiety and reduce its relation to poor math performance, future interventions may benefit from focusing on both math-anxious individuals themselves and those around them."

Controlling for gender, age and prior academic aptitude, self-perceived problem-solving abilities, measured on entry to university, had direct beneficial effects on psychosocial adjustment to university, perceived stress levels, self-determined motivational orientations, and academic performance during students’ second year of study. Additionally, social problem-solving appraisals, adjustment to university and intrinsic motivation towards accomplishment predicted higher marks over the course of students’ 3 years at university, controlling for university entry qualifications. Gender differences emerged in perceived stress, self-determination profiles, and academic performance, with women displaying higher scores than men. More specific analysis of problem-solving appraisals indicated that different dimensions (e.g. control, confidence) had different long-range adaptational outcomes. Results are discussed with reference to models of social problem-solving (D'Zurilla, 1986, 1990) and self-determination (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 1991) and implications for interventions based on problem-solving training for stress management are considered."

 abstract = {Results of 151 studies were integrated by meta-analysis to scrutinize the construct mathematics anxiety. Mathematics anxiety is related to poor performance on mathematics achievement tests. It relates inversely to positive attitudes toward mathematics and is bound directly to avoidance of the subject. Variables that exhibit differential mathematics anxiety levels include ability, school grade level, and undergraduate fields of study, with preservice arithmetic teachers especially prone to mathematics anxiety. Females display higher levels than males. However, mathematics anxiety appears more strongly linked with poor performance and avoidance of mathematics in precollege males than females. A variety of treatments are effective in reducing mathematics anxiety. Improved mathematics performance consistently accompanies valid treatment.},

The correlations found between measures of the 2 constructs were nearly as high as those found within measures of the 2 constructs, bringing into question the separateness of the constructs. Results of the confirmatory factor analysis provided some support for a distinction between the constructs; the correlation between the 2 factors, however, was relatively high. Those findings suggest that mathematics anxiety and test anxiety may be separate phenomena; the conceptual uniqueness of mathematics anxiety, however, needs to be further delineated and its measurement improved. }

  abstract = { The linear relations between math anxiety and math cognition have been frequently studied. However, the relations between anxiety and performance on complex cognitive tasks have been repeatedly demonstrated to follow a curvilinear fashion. In the current studies, we aimed to address the lack of attention given to the possibility of such complex interplay between emotion and cognition in the math-learning literature by exploring the relations among math anxiety, math motivation, and math cognition. In two samples—young adolescent twins and adult college students—results showed inverted-U relations between math anxiety and math performance in participants with high intrinsic math motivation and modest negative associations between math anxiety and math performance in participants with low intrinsic math motivation. However, this pattern was not observed in tasks assessing participants’ nonsymbolic and symbolic number-estimation ability. These findings may help advance the understanding of mathematics-learning processes and provide important insights for treatment programs that target improving mathematics-learning experiences and mathematical skills. },

To address this issue, research must better identify barriers to dissemination of these treatments. This study investigated patient preferences for PTSD treatment given a wide range of treatment options in an analog sample. One hundred and sixty individuals, with varying degrees of trauma history, were asked to imagine themselves undergoing a trauma, developing PTSD, and seeking treatment. Participants evaluated seven different treatment descriptions, which depicted treatment options that they might encounter in a clinical setting. Participants rated their most and least preferred treatments along with their personal reactions to and the perceived credibility of each treatment. Participants also completed a critical thinking skills questionnaire. Participants predominantly chose exposure or another variant of cognitive–behavioral therapy as their most preferred therapy, and those who chose exclusively empirically supported treatments evidenced higher critical thinking skills. The present study contributes to a growing literature indicating that patients may be more interested in these therapies than indicated by utilization rates. The problem of underutilization of empirically supported treatments for PTSD in clinical practice may be due to therapist factors.},

  abstract  = {Math anxiety is a negative emotional reaction that is characterized by feelings of stress and anxiety in situations involving mathematical problem solving. High math-anxious individuals tend to avoid situations involving mathematics and are less likely to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math-related careers than those with low math anxiety. Math anxiety during childhood, in particular, has adverse long-term consequences for academic and professional success. Identifying cognitive interventions and brain mechanisms by which math anxiety can be ameliorated in children is therefore critical. Here we investigate whether an intensive 8 week one-to-one cognitive tutoring program designed to improve mathematical skills reduces childhood math anxiety, and we identify the neurobiological mechanisms by which math anxiety can be reduced in affected children. Forty-six children in grade 3, a critical early-onset period for math anxiety, participated in the cognitive tutoring program. High math-anxious children showed a significant reduction in math anxiety after tutoring. Remarkably, tutoring remediated aberrant functional responses and connectivity in emotion-related circuits anchored in the basolateral amygdala. Crucially, children with greater tutoring-induced decreases in amygdala reactivity had larger reductions in math anxiety. Our study demonstrates that sustained exposure to mathematical stimuli can reduce math anxiety and highlights the key role of the amygdala in this process. Our findings are consistent with models of exposure-based therapy for anxiety disorders and have the potential to inform the early treatment of a disability that, if left untreated in childhood, can lead to significant lifelong educational and socioeconomic consequences in affected individuals.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Math anxiety during early childhood has adverse long-term consequences for academic and professional success. It is therefore important to identify ways to alleviate math anxiety in young children. Surprisingly, there have been no studies of cognitive interventions and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms by which math anxiety can be ameliorated in young children. Here, we demonstrate that intensive 8 week one-to-one cognitive tutoring not only reduces math anxiety but also remarkably remediates aberrant functional responses and connectivity in emotion-related circuits anchored in the amygdala. Our findings are likely to propel new ways of thinking about early treatment of a disability that has significant implications for improving each individual{\textquoteright}s academic and professional chances of success in today{\textquoteright}s technological society that increasingly demands strong quantitative skills.},

Nearly all students experience testing situations as stressful, and signs of stress (e.g., racing heart) are typically perceived negatively. This research tested the efficacy of a psychosituational intervention targeting cognitive appraisals of stress to improve classroom exam performance. Ninety-three students (across five semesters) enrolled in a community college developmental mathematics course were randomly assigned to stress reappraisal or placebo control conditions. Reappraisal instructions educated students about the adaptive benefits of stress arousal, whereas placebo materials instructed students to ignore stress. Reappraisal students reported less math evaluation anxiety and exhibited improved math exam performance relative to controls. Mediation analysis indicated reappraisal improved performance by increasing students’ perceptions of their ability to cope with the stressful testing situation (resource appraisals). Implications for theory development and policy are discussed. },

MARS scores were higher when the test was administered by computer, vs. the standard paper-and-pencil format, and were higher for female than male college students. Small but significant processing differences in simple addition and multiplication were found when subjects were divided by quartiles into anxiety groups. Much larger differences in processing speed and accuracy were found with complex addition problems and a set of difficult problems (e.g. 9 × 16 = 134, true or false) that tested all four arithmetic operations. Overall, the low anxiety group was consistently the most rapid and accurate, the medium high was consistently the slowest, and the high anxiety group the most prone to errors. The results suggest that genuine performance differences exist among the several levels of mathematics anxiety, and that chronometric, reaction time-based studies of such performance will be useful in revealing those differences. },

The psychometric literature is also very clear on the global consequences of mathematics anxiety. People who are highly math anxious avoid math: They avoid elective coursework in math, both in high school and college, they avoid college majors that emphasize math, and they avoid career paths that involve math. We go beyond these psychometric relationships to examine the cognitive consequences of math anxiety. We show how performance on a standardized math achievement test varies as a function of math anxiety, and that math anxiety compromises the functioning of working memory. High math anxiety works much like a dual task setting: Preoccupation with one's math fears and anxieties functions like a resource-demanding secondary task. We comment on developmental and educational factors related to math and working memory, and on factors that may contribute to the development of math anxiety.},

A fourth subscale, general self-worth, independent of any particular skill domain, was included. A new question format was devised which provides a broader range of responses and reduces the tendency to give socially desirable responses. The psychometric properties of the scale are presented for third through ninth grades. Emphasis is placed on its factorial validity. Each subscale defines a separate factor, indicating that children make clear differentiations among these domains. The factor structure is extremely stable across this grade range.

Negative preconceptions have been noted as being of major concern with adult learners, both preconceptions of mathematics in general and also of their own abilities. In addition to this, it was hoped that Head Start Maths might lead to increased retention rates among adult learners and lead to less dropouts within the first semester. Results found that there were statistically significant increases in self-efficacy scores across some, but not all, of the mathematical topic areas and that there was an increase in the retention rates of adult learners who participated in Head Start Maths compared to those who did not. },

On one dimension the conceptions relate to cognitive functions: the course bridges students’ difficulties with mathematical concepts, helps develop strategies for learning mathematics and extends skills in thinking and reasoning. Categories on the other dimension reflect ideas on how the bridging course advances personal goals and enhances self-development. The findings show that students are aware of the value of the bridging courses not only to ameliorate prior difficulties with mathematics and improve their approaches to learning mathematics but, less transparently, as an important opportunity to facilitate their transition into higher education, meet fellow students and help realise their potential. },

journal={Mathematics Education Research Journal},

month={Sep},
day={1},
volume={20},
number={2},
pages={25--37},
abstract={One of most notable features of existing body of research in transition seems to be the absence of a theoretical model. The suggestion we present in this paper---to view and understand the high school to university transition in mathematics as a modern-day rite of passage---is an attempt at defining such framework. Although dominantly reflecting North-American reality, we believe that the model could be found useful in other countries as well. Let us emphasize that our model is not new in the sense that it recognizes the transition as such. In this paper, we try to determine whether (and, if so, how) the notion of a rite of passage---which is a well-understood concept in anthropology, as well as in some other disciplines (e.g. culture shock in cultural studies)---can help us understand mathematics transition issues better. Can it help us systematize existing body of research, and enhance our understanding of transition in mathematics; does it point at something new? We believe so, and by elaborating some traditional aspects of rites of passage, we hope to provide a useful lens through which we can examine the process of transition in mathematics, and make suggestions for improved management of some transitional issues.},

Mathematics performance was correlated moderately with mathematics self-efficacy. No support was found for Hackett and Betz's (1981) hypothesis that women's mathematics self-efficacy expectations are unrealistically low compared to men's. Both mathematics performance and mathematics self-efficacy were significantly and positively correlated with attitudes toward mathematics, masculine sex-role orientation, and a mathematics-related major. Regression analyses supported the superiority of mathematics self-efficacy over mathematics performance and achievement variables in predicting the choice of a mathematics-related major.},
