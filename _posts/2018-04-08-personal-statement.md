The Seminar 8 task was to: 

1. Read Chapters 1 (already read) and 6 of Churchill et al. (2013)[^Churchill2013].
2. Watch the powerpoint presentation Australian Curriculum Seminar 8 (available on CANVAS), and reflecting on my Seminar 8 experience, respond to the following questions:
 - What teacher traits do you identify with?
 - Of the 7 APST Standards which do you already associate with and why?

4. Use the 3 key domains of teaching from the APST, *Professional Knowledge*, *Professional Practice* and *Professional Engagement* to structure the first stages of your personal statement.

5. Begin working on your Personal Statement: My philosophy of teaching - what kind of teacher am I/do I want to be and why? What is the role of a teacher in the process of learning? and post this to your e-portfolio, remember this is very much a first attempt and will continue to change and develop as you grow as an educator.

I had a go and drafted a personal statement on March 16 2018, which I just uploaded to [the splash page of my eportfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.md %}). Although I originally started by structuring it around the 3 key domains of teaching from the APST, as I edited it evolved beyond that, although some remnants of it remain and each of the domains are still discussed, just not used for structure.
