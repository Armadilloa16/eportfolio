Today I attended a Webinar entitled "Understanding Aboriginality" presented by Dr Sheelagh Daniels-Mayes, Shirley Gilbert and Dr Graeme Gower. Interesting timing as well as last monday we had a lecture by Dr Linda Westphalen and Michael Corbung on Aboriginality. Here I'll sum up some of the key take-away messages I got from the Webinar.

What is aboriginality? Although there are recognised definers:
 - You identify as Aboriginal/ TS islander.
 - You have Aboriginality/ TS islander heritage.
 - You are accepted as being Aboriginal/ TS islander by the community in which you live or have lived.
these can be problematic as proving histories can be difficult. Aboriginality is more than just a piece of paper. Aboriginality is about identity, about world-view. It is about language/ sub-language kin-group or kinship group and peoples relationship to the land. It is about heritage, but also about how one identifies within their community and how their community identifies with them. 

They covered some pointers on terminology:
 - "Aborigine" is considered a very offensive term now. Aboriginal people would have a preference for "Aboriginal" over "Aborigine".
 - "People" refers to a single group while the term "Peoples" recognises that there are multiple groups.
 - "Indigenous" is often considered offensive despite being used by UN legislations etc.
 - "Acknowledgment of" vs. "Welcome to" Country. Anyone can acknowledge, only a custodian of the land can welcome.

As Linda mentioned in the professional experience lecture earlier in the week, the main take-home message is: "ask what people what to be called".

Before european settlement there where many languages spoken in Australian (670+), but now there are only 150 languages spoken, with only 50 or so of which spoken fluently. Many such kids are talented linguists learning many languages, learning english as a tenth language or so. This can go towards the culture of high-expectations we should be fostering, something else they shared with Linda's lecture, although they focused on it less. Use the talents of the kids to build upon and develop relationships of mutual respect and high expectations.

Where do we go as teachers for professional development etc. Its a matter of humility to admit we don't know everything and we need to learn. Ask aboriginal people to help us to learn. 

What does "cultural safety" mean?
 - A safe environment in which peoples culture can be practices without being challenged or questioned.
 
Cultural power imbalances exist. Addressing APST 1.4 and 2.4 involves:
 - using education to empower and recognise cultural assets.
 - Culturally safe school through a high-expectations approach.

Cultural safety is relevant in staffrooms, attitude to students, and power imbalances. Staffrooms should be inclusive, less clique-y. Put up [posters](http://www.naidoc.org.au/get-your-copy-2018-poster), flags, etc. this can help start conversations. 

How to make a space more culturally safe? 
 - Build relationships, 
 - Build your knowledge base (invite elders, parents, carers, ... ),
 - Form reciprocal relationships,
 - Celebrate, 
 - Include in decision-making.
