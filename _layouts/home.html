  Welcome! My name is Lyron Winderbaum, and this is my portfolio. This page has some information about me, including:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="#statement">My Personal Statement:</a> My perspective of teaching, the role of a teacher, and the kind of teacher I aspire to be. </li>
    <li> <a href="#background">A Short History:</a> Where I am from and how I came to be a teacher</li>
	<li> <a href="#influences"> Influences and Hobbies </a> Some deeper insight into the people and things that influences me to believe what I believe, and become the person I am, as well as some of my general ``extra-curricular'' interests. </li>

  <h1 id="statement">Personal Statement</h1>
  
  <p>I aspire to be the kind of teacher that creates a safe environment in which students can interact and learn. <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-4">APST 4</a>)--> I think achieving this goal will be a lifelong journey, and not an easy one. Three core values of mine sit at the centre of my strategy for achieving this goal:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#lifelong-learning">Lifelong Learning</a></li>
    <li><a href="#transparency">Transparency</a></li>
    <li><a href="#dont-assume">Inclusive Language and Behavior</a></li>
  </ul></p>

  <h2 id="lifelong-learning">Lifelong Learning</h2>
    
  <p>In order to create a safe environment for students to interact and learn I will need to tackle obstacles of many different types: social, cultural, academic, bureaucratic, political. Perhaps most importantly of all I will need to embrace and encourage constant and ongoing self-reflection and constructive criticism. Naturally, these processes will lead to a life of constant learning <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-1">APST 1</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-2">APST 2</a>)--> and development <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-6">APST 6</a>)--> on my part as I constantly strive to improve. I embrace this, and actively seek it, relishing each chance to learn and improve.</p>

  <h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>
  
  <p>I value transparency highly, and aspire to be as transparent as possible in my teaching as well as in my personal development. Providing students with indepth feedback <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-5">APST 5</a>)--> is crucial for supporting learning, and I think being transparent in my assessment tasks can support this goal well. My hope is that transparency can not only improve feedback to students, but also demonstrate my dedication to integrity and encouraging collaboration. My hope that transparency will encourage collaboration applies not only to collaboration with students, but with colleagues, parents, and the community at large as well. I hope that through transparency I can also find ways to encourage stakeholders to give me feedback on how I can improve my teaching. I expect interaction with colleagues, parents, students, and the community at large <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-7">APST 7</a>)--> to provide some of the most useful information for continual improvement as a teacher, which is my day-to-day goal even while my ultimate goal remains to create a safe environment in which students can interact and learn.</p>

  <h2 id="dont-assume">Inclusive Language and Behavior</h2>
  
  <p>I think thoughtful behavior and use of language are powerful tools for communicating to those around us that they are safe, not being judged, and welcome. Although sometimes these things can be subtle, I believe the impact of these subtleties can be anything but. Small and perhaps seemingly innocuous adjustments to our behavior and use of language can create massive shifts in the way people around us feel and perceive us. I think developing keener awareness of the impact of my own behaviors and use of language, and making continual adjustments, will be key to creating environments in which students can feel safe and welcome, as well as being important in developing professional relationships with colleagues, parents, and more.</p>

  

  <h1 id="background">A Short History</h1>

  <p>I was born in Jerusalem, Israel, in 1989 and can speak and understand Hebrew fluently. Since then I also learnt how to read and write but I still haven't spent alot of time practicing so my reading and writing in Hebrew is fairly basic. My family moved to Australia in 1992, when I was three years old, and since then I lived in the Adelaide hills until I moved out of home into the inner suburbs.</p>
  
  <p> After graduating highschool in 2006 I went straight to university, studying a Bachelor of Science because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do yet exactly, but I knew it was in the Science/ Maths field. I changed my mind about what I wanted to major in every year of my undergraduate degree, finally graduating in 2010 with three majors: Chemistry, Pure Mathematics, and Statistics.</p>

  <p>In 2011 I started (and completed) my honours through the School of Mathematical Sciences in the discipline of statistics, working on a project analysing LA-ICP-MS geochemical data from pyrite sections under the supervision of Associate Professor Andrew Metcalfe. At the same time (also in 2011) I started teaching at the University of Adelaide: tutoring, marking, and demonstrating through the School of Mathematical Sciences, and also through the Maths Learning Centre --- where I developed a love for helping people find the joy in mathematics. Working at the Maths Learning Centre with Dr. David Butler is also when the seeds where first planted that would later grow into my passion for teaching, although I didn't know that at the time.</p> 
  
  <p>In 2012 I continued my trajectory into academia, beginning my PhD project on [``the statistical analysis of proteomics imaging mass spectrometry data''](https://github.com/Armadilloa16/thesis/blob/master/whole_thesis.pdf), which I worked on until it was accepted for the degree in 2016. During that time interspersed between my PhD candidature I worked as a research assistant, and also continued teaching eventually dropping the teaching work through the School of Mathematical Sciences, but continuing to work through the Maths Learning Centre for the entire time.</p>

  <p> After I completed my PhD I continued working in the field as a postdoctoral research assistant for over a year (including all of 2017). At the beginning of 2017 I was asked to take on a full time research position at the University of Adelaide, which I initially accepted, but as a consequence I had to give up on teaching through the Maths Learning Centre. It was during this time that I realised the importance teaching had grown to have for me. I was unhappy in academia and I missed teaching. I starting going into the Maths Learning Centre and helping students there in my own free time, in my lunch breaks and so on. It was when I was doing this that I realised...if there is a job that I enjoy so much that I would volunteer to go and do it in my free time purely for my own enjoyment... that is probably what I should be doing with my life. Initially I only took a half-step towards this, asking to go down to a part-time load of research so that I could start teaching again, which satisfied me for a time, but when my research funding ran out at the end of 2017 and I needed to make a choice about what I wanted to focus on going forward: apply for more research positions, or pursue teaching full time, the choice for me was obvious --- and so I enrolled in the Master of Teaching program. </p>

  <h1 id="influences">Influences and Hobbies</h1>
  
  <p>Along the way I have been inspired by many people. Dan Kortchak helped me learn that thinking about problems from the perspective of a systems engineer as opposed to that of a mathematician, and helped me explore the differences. The writing of Paul Halmos inspired me with it's concise eloquence. But most of all the enthusiasm and pedagogy of David Butler's teaching practice at the Maths Learning Centre truely inspired me to be a better teacher.</p>

  <p>Brendan Bentley once said in the first intensive week of my Master of Teaching program, "Don't Assume", and that hit a powerful chord with me, reflecting my view on the importance of behaviour and the use of language in creating welcoming environments. In context, he was pointing out that when a student shows up late or falls asleep in class, you don't know what they have been through --- maybe their mum is sick in the hospital and they where up all night caring for her, you have no idea what they've been through. Don't Assume. That resonated with me.</p>
