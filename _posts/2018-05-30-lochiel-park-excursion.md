Last week I went in for my placement induction, and while there I met my mentor teacher. They told me they were taking their year 8/9 STEM class on an excursion to [Lochiel Park](https://renewalsa.sa.gov.au/projects/lochiel-park/) and invited me along. They sent me [this letter]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/placement/nmhs/excursion-letter.pdf) with all the details.
