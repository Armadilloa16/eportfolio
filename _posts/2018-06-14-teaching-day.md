I did lesson plans for these lessons as well, both [for science]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/lesson_plans/20180614_lesson12_plan.pdf) and [for maths]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/lesson_plans/20180614_lesson3_plan.pdf), but much like before, I ended up veering off the plan in both cases, but it still turned out well.



## Periods 1-2: Science

In science I reviewed Newton's first two laws, and introduced the third with the help of [this prezi](https://prezi.com/view/usf192Co4DWtAdaiVDVj/), and showed [this video](https://youtu.be/8bTdMmNZm2M) to help challenge some of the common misconceptions surrounding Newton's third law. I then spent the rest of the lesson helping individuals with their prac reports that would be due later today.



## Periods 3: Maths

This single went really quickly, I continued to give individual support with the current (imdb movies) DI, basically.
