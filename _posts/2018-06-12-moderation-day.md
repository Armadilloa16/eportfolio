Today was a student free day, in which all the teachers in a group of eastern schools got together to do moderation, which I participated in. In the first half of the day we went to Open Access College were we did maths moderation. I learnt some interesting things chatting with a few teachers from Glenunga at our table, specifically about flipped learning, and one of them introduced me to a tool he uses a lot for flipped learning --- [EdPuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/). I also got [a certificate]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/moderation-certificate.pdf) for completing a feedback form about the moderation day. 

In the second half of the day we went back to senior campus, and worked on assessment tasks. We spoke with the other maths teachers about the upcoming semester change-over, and discussed assessment tasks for the upcoming topics. My mentor teacher whipped together a one-lesson probability test, which I later edited with some small improvements. 

TODO: Upload the test I edited? After it's been given to the students maybe?
