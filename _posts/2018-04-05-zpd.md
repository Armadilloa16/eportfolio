The Seminar 5 task was to: 

1. Read both the Sweller and Chandler (1991)[^Sweller1991] and Vygotsky (1978)[^Vygotsky1978] readings, along with Chapter 4 of Churchill et al. (2013)[^Churchill2013]. You may find it useful to refer back to Chapter 3 of Churchill et al. (2013)[^Churchill2013] (already read).
2. Reflect on my learning experiences.
3. Identify one learning/experience that I had difficulty with.
4. Write out the sequence of schema (knowledge or thinking) I think I needed to master that learning experience.
5. Identify what learning/experiences I missed out on that effected my successful mastery of the learning.
6. I may wish to discuss this with a Critical Friend. A significant part of teaching is to review the prior knowledge/schema of a student to develop the next lesson in their learning journey. If I can analyse my own thinking by thinking about my thinking (meta-cognition), I will be empowered to improve my own learning.
7. Record my thoughts in your e-portfolio.
