After spending the first two days of placement doing observation, today it was time for my first lesson teaching. I made [a lesson plan]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/lessons/20180606/06062018_lesson56_plan.pdf) which I promptly ingored, but was helpful for sparking discussion with my mentor teacher about timings. More importantly, I prepared an activity were students would measure each others heights with measuring tape (an idea from one of the other classes my mentor teacher taught earlier in the week, that they called the "Human Boxplot" activity), and I made [a worksheet]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/lessons/20180606/worksheet.pdf) ([source also available]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/lessons/20180606/worksheet.tex)). The original worksheet had the students names on it though, so I've replaced their names with "JOHN DOE" and "JANE DOE" for anonymity purposes in the version attached. Below is an image of some of the whiteboard work I did, demonstrating how to construct a boxplot to scale from a 5-number summary.

My mentor wrote a full double sided A4 page of feedback for me for the class, which we went through quickly afterwards and was very helpful. I won't post it here though, because it includes explicit mention of specific students by name.
