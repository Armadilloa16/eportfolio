Today I attended the UWA Teaching Excellence conference. There were keynotes on incorporating ethics into curriculum and in particular the term "social entrepeneurship", the term "employability" and what it really means, and the [higher education Acaedemy](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/), which seemed one part the tertiary sector's attempt at an equivalent of the APST AITSL standards and one part mentoring scheme. It seemed like a nice idea and prompted me to reflect on the role of such standards in giving educators a framework within which to improve but more importantly making a statement about the values of the educational community and the importance of the validation that provides to educators already struggling to acheive these goals but not feeling supported by their community.
