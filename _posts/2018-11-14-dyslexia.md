Other than [the conference]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-25-EFIconference %}), the other assignment for Education for Inclusion (EFI) was to research a topic. If our presentation at the conference was to be related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education, then our research paper should be on a disability and vice versa. As I chose to give my conference presentation on a topic related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education, I chose to do my research paper on dyslexia as it is a very prevalent disability, and one which I think it is important to know about and know how to accomodate --- so I chose the topic partially as a reason to educate myself on the topic.

One of the topics was font, so I compiled two versions of the paper:
 - one in the [dyslexia-specific font "Open Dyslexic"]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/dyslexia_research/OpenDyslexic.zip) (specifically I used OpenDyslexic3). Both the [compiled pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/dyslexia_research/paper_OpenDys.pdf) and [source .tex]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/dyslexia_research/paper_OpenDys.tex) are available.
 - one in Computer Modern Sans Serif font. Again, both the [compiled pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/dyslexia_research/paper_CMU.pdf) and [source .tex]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/dyslexia_research/paper_CMU.tex).
the [BibTeX file]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/dyslexia_research/citations.bib) with the associateed references is also available.
