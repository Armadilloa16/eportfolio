We where set a task to select a resource which could be incorporated into the teaching of a SACE Stage 1 or Stage 2 Chemistry. 

I chose [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) to present on, see the 
Analysis Table [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/resources/files/FeynmanLectures.docx), and slides [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/resources/feynman.html).

I actually looked into quite a few other resources as well, so I'll include them here as well for later reference:
- [Scootle](https://www.scootle.edu.au), Australian Curriculum material up to year 10, I almost picked this for my assignment actually and even prepared an Analysis Table, see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/resources/files/Scootle.docx).
