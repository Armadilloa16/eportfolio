Today was the first day of my new job at the University of Western Australia (UWA). I've moved to Perth to accept the position, and we will see how things go.

I'm going to aim to keep this blog/ site education focused and so will only post very minimally on purely research based work I do, but I also plan to stay in the education game and I'll update this blog with education related things. I'll also maybe occasionally post something personal or research related but that will be de-emphasised. For example I might update this post with some personal reflection on my move to Perth, finding an apartment, etc. and occasionally I might post something about my research but most of the posts to this site should remain education focused.
