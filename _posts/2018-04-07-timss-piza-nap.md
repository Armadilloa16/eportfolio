Then Seminar 7 task was to: 

1. Read Bruniges (2005)[^Bruniges2005], Chapters 8 and 9 of Brady and Kennedy (2012)[^Brady2012], and Reid (2013)[^Reid2013].
2. View the TIMSS PISA Seminar 7 powerpoint (available on CANVAS).
3. If I were sitting in a school staffroom and asked ``Should we have national and international benchmark testing of Australian students?'' what would my response be drawing upon the above resources? Write a response using the sentence starter, "I believe............" in less than 400 words.
4. Post my response to your e-portfolio.
