We were tasked to teach a stage 1 or stage 2 relevant topic to our fellow student teachers for 4-5min, [the instructions and rubrik are available here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/mathTeach5min/TeachFor5min.docx).

I brought some silver rhombic dodecahedra, and passed them around telling them it was my favourite shape. I then explained how dodeca means 12, hedra means solid with flat surfaces, rhombic means those surfaces are rhombi, and silver refers to the specific rhombus --- the ratio of it's diagonals, even more specifically. Then I went on to explain how not just any rhombus would fit together into a dodecahedron, and how this one is special because it has a specific ratio of its diagonals --- the silver ratio or the square root of 2. I then talked about why that means it can be made out of A4 paper easily (because A4 paper has the same ratio), and why A4 paper has that ratio (because of the property people wanted it to have that when you halve it you get two rectangles of the same ratio as the larger one you started with. I then went on to explain how there is one other ratio that allows a rhombic dodecahedron to be constructed --- the golden ratio, and showed how that comes from the solutions to a quadratic that results from asserting a similar property: that when you remove a square with edge lengths equal to the short edge length of the rectangle, what you are left with is a rectangle similar (same ratio) to the larger rectangle you started with.

At the beggining I accidentally handed out the dodecahedra unevenly between the two sides of the class, and so I encouraged them to chuck them between each other. One person tried to hit one abit hard (volleyball style), and it fell apart into its constituent parts: which actually served really well to demonstrate how they are constructed out of the units, so that worked out really well. People seemed to enjoy the presentatione even though it was the last one of the day, at 7pm on a Friday evening.
