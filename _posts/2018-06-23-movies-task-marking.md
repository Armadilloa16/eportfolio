I started with my year 10 maths classes on the topic of statistics, and I introduced to them the summative assessment item for the topic: a directed investigation based on comparing movie ratings from IMDB. The task involved calculating 5-number summaries, constructing boxpots, histograms, and other graphs in order to compare the ratings given to movies by different demographics. The data was quite challenging to calculate 5-number summaries for due to it's nature and size.

I marked a complete classes [movies DI]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/resources/Movies_DI_task_sheet.pdf) this weekend. My mentor teacher helped with marking the other class. Similar to the [inertia prac for science]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-20-inertia-report-marking %}), giving them this DI was one of the [first things I did with them]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-08-full-day-of-teaching %}), and so they had been working on it for the whole time I had them.

I haven't include any of the reports themselves as they include identifying details of the students, but I can include a couple of anonymised samples of student work. This is the beginning discussion and assumptions/ limitations sections of one outstanding students work.

This is an outstanding conclusion section written by another student.
