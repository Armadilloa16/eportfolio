In this term we are focusing on assessment in maths C&M, and to that end I decided it would be a useful sink of my time to organise and sort out the various performance standards in SACE mathematics subject. I made [a document]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/MathsPerformanceStandards.pdf) that is intended to both clarify which SACE mathematics subjects share performance standards and also to aid marking by highlighting key differences of the grading scheme and organising these next to each other to make comparisons easier.
