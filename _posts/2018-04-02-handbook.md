We where tasked to create a handbook of classroom management strategies for Student Teacher in the Classroom (STiC), [the instructions and rubric are available]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/handbook/files/STiCassignment1.pdf). The word count was... brutally low, and [the version I submitted]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/handbook/handbook.pdf) is EXACTLY on the word count, as noted in a footnote on the fifth page, which also refers to [a text-only version]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/handbook/files/Handbook_textonly.docx) (which is how I did the word count) and gives a link to it on google docs, but I include the link previous incase the google docs link expires. Also of note, I wrote the handbook in LaTeX, and here is [the source file]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/handbook/handbook.tex).
