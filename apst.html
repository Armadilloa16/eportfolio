The  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/APST.pdf">Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST)</a> are summarised here under their three main headings, and listed below in more detail with my reflections and evidence for each. Illustrations of these standards, as well as further details can also be found on the <a href="https://www.aitsl.edu.au/teach/standards">Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) website</a>.

The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-02-handbook %}">handbook assignment for Student Teacher Interaction in the Classroom</a> involved researching several developmental models (including those mentioned above) and summarising their key points concisely.

	</td>
    <td>
		
		<p>My work at the MLC has served a massive role in developing my knowledge and understanding of strategies for differentiating teaching to meet the needs of different students. The other day I was working a MLC shift and one of my fellow student teachers was observing me, and when we reflected on the experience, one of the key things that came out of it was the ability to rapidly switch mindset between talking to a third year pure maths student talking about topology and category theory, to a first year student struggling with rearranging an equation --- a valuable skill that I have not always had, but have managed to improve on dramatically over the years of working at the MLC. Maybe I should write a post about this explicitly, but for now I suppose <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-02-mlc-slack-post %}">my slack channel post</a> will have to do as far as evidence of this goes. I also think the unit plans I constructed as part of the C&M courses, for both <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-30-chem-topic-folio %}">chemistry</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-23-maths-unit-plan %}">maths</a>, demonstrate some strategies for differentiation, allowing students who are bored to get ahead, while leaving time for me to spend more time with, and provide more resources for, the students who are struggling.</p>
