# First 3 Weeks

In the first week we started the topic of statistics with the year 10 maths class with an activity on interpreting data, we got the students to go on gapminder and find something interesting, then present it to the class. Then in week 2 we gave them the summative assignment and started helping them through it step by step. I made some videos (flipped learning) to extend some students into some programming.

# Week 4

Started Indices? Eddie with the fractal idea.

# Week 5

Jason away on Ski Trip, did dodecahedra, ups and downs, etc.

# Week 6

Jason back. Did crash course on indices for those that were away on ski trip, pushed others to try formative investigation.
