Over the weekend I marked just about the whole classes inertia prac reports, which they had completed right before I started teaching them and [I had been helping them write right from the start of placement]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-08-full-day-of-teaching %}). Here are direct links to the [inertia prac report task sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/resources/Interia_prac_report_task_sheet.pdf), for and [the scaffold]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/resources/Interia_prac_report_scaffold.pdf) they had to help them structure their report. 

TODO: I haven't include any of the reports themselves as they include identifying details of the students, but maybe I could anonymise some examples to use as evidence.
