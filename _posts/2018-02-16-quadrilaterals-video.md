We where set a task to make a video of approximately 3 minutes duration that relates to a topic in a SACE Stage 1 or 2 Mathematics course. The full instructions are [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/VideoTask.pdf).

I uploaded the video I made to YouTube, and it can be accessed via [this link](https://youtu.be/zUL2OBqF-qQ).

The tasks also asks that the video be accompanied by a rationale identifying the concepts involved, describes the intended learners, and explains why the video will be effective for learning

**Concepts Involved:** The video explores quadrilaterals inscribed in circles. This is relevant too and inspired by the SACE Subject Outline for Stage 1 Mathematics, Subtopic 8.1: Circle Properties. Specifically, it uses the key concept "Angles at the circumference subtended by the same arc are equal" and was inspired by the consideration for developing learning and teaching strategies. It also tangentially touches on the concepts of Subtopic 8.2: The nature of proof, by showing how the key concept above could be investigated by trial and error using electronic technology.

**Intended Learners:** This is intended for Stage 1 Mathematics students who have already been introduced to the theorem "Angles at the circumference subtended by the same arc are equal" and who have been prompted to think about how to inscribe a rectangle in a circle, and introduced to the more general concept of a quadrilateral.

**Intended Learning:** There are a couple of ways in which I could see this video being used as a learning tool:
- It introduces the concept of using electronic technology to play with ideas to gain some intuition when exploring the theorem "Angles at the circumference subtended by the same arc are equal". This is intended both to reinforce the key concept by revisiting it from a new perspective, and also to introduce the students to an example of using electronic technology to explore geometric properties and gain intuition about them which can then be used to either form hypotheses (and attempt proofs) or understand properties well enough to use them to solve problems.
- It introduces a proof that opposite angles of a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle are complimentary. This could be used either as an example of a proof and as a new theorem that could be used in future problems, or it could be used as a solution for a problem that had been set to the class previously, something like "What special properties does a quadrilateral that is inscribed in a circle have that all quadrilaterals might not have?" for example.

**Reflection:** In hindsight, the video was actually qutie abit longer than it should have been (4:38) and it might actually have made sense to separate the two concepts discussed above under "Intended Learning" into two videos, given their different uses. This would also have kept the individual video length much shorter. Something for me to keep in mind next time.
