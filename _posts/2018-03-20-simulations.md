TODO: Posted at due date.

We where tasked to reflect on the simulations we did in the tutorials for Student Teacher in the Classroom (STiC), the instructions for the task are available [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/STiCassignment2.pdf). We did three simulations, with increasing amount of misbehavior:

# Simulation 1

This first simulation was mostly focused on presentation --- body language, speech mannerisms, praise, using students names, and whiteboard work. The  following sessions will involve increasing amounts of misbehavior from the students to test our ability to manage them but this session was mostly focused on setting a baseline for our teaching without misbehavior.

I uploaded the video I made to YouTube, and it can be accessed via [this link](https://youtu.be/gq8I5YF4bg4).

**Reflections:** 
- So bouncy!
- Whiteboard work was ok I think. I turned my back to the board to write on it, and occasionally talked while doing so (bad), but managed to spend the majority of my exposition time facing the class.
- I think I didn't use names enough -- definitely something to work on. 
- Went from abstract to concrete, could try going the other way.
- Preparation, I planned the class reasonably I think, it fit to time, I brought string which was fun, and reviewed the material enough that my familiarity with the material didn't hinder me at all.
- I don't think I used praise enough, would like to improve on that.
 
# Simulation 2

The second simulation introuced one misbehaving student in the form of a ransomly assigned attention seeking student. The misbehviour took me quite off balance and I felt quite overwhelmed actually.

I could have done better by preparing better.
