This week seemed to fly by, I think I started to feel slightly less overwhelmed by the new-ness of the environment and started really getting into the rhythm of teaching more. So I'll write this summary of the entire week by subject instead of lesson by lesson, as I didn't get to do daily summaries this time (got distracted putting my head down and doing the teaching, I guess). But also because this allows me to discuss how each of the classes progressed through the week instead of focusing on a lesson-by-lesson breakthrough in which the overall flow is more difficult to see and discuss, and part of what happened this week was I started to think about the overall direction of the teaching/ learning in each class, meeting objectives, etc.
