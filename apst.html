<p>The  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/APST.pdf">Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST)</a> are summarised here under their three main headings, and listed below in more detail with my reflections and evidence for each. Illustrations of these standards, as well as further details can also be found on the <a href="https://www.aitsl.edu.au/teach/standards">Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) website</a>.</p>

<p>The bulk of the evidence for these standards come from my two placements, the first at Norwood Morialta Highschool (NMHS) and the second at Blackwood Highschool (BHS), with some evidence also coming from coursework I have completed as part of the Master of Teaching program, and other external professional development I have engaged in. I've included some direct feedback given to me from my mentor teachers on this page, but all other evidence is available through hyperlinks to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog">my reflections</a>.</p>

<p>This constituted a Self-Review Audit of the APST standards for Graduate Level, and those responses have been copied into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PiYiP2vZg1FYfGxkuWOpVCB6Nt5vgaAWKWLiqhJquGc/edit?usp=sharing">the relevant template here</a>. However this is also a living document, and will continue to evolve in an ongoing manner as I continue towards the Profcient Level of the APST standards</p>

<p>That being said, the result of my Self-Review Audit was:
<ul>

<p>For ease of navigation, a list of the 37 standards are provided here, each hyperlinked to the appropriate point on this page:</p>

The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-06-mhfa %}">Mental Health First Aid training</a> I volunteered for helped to broaden my understanding of the social and physical developmental risks involved with mental illness. As <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-05-zpd %}">one of the seminar tasks in the core C&M course</a>, I reflected on two papers on Cognitive Load Theory and Zone of Proximal Development (Sweller and Chandler (1991) and Vygotsky (1978) respectively), popular (and practically useful) theories relating to the process of learning and teaching, and the development of knowledge in students. The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-02-handbook %}">handbook assignment for Student Teacher Interaction in the Classroom</a> involved researching several developmental models (including those mentioned above) and summarising their key points concisely. This helped me place this knowledge in the broader context of competing and complementary theories, and to focus on understanding these theories all from the perspective of how they can be useful to improve my teaching.</p>

		<p>My work at the MLC has served a massive role in developing my knowledge and understanding of strategies for differentiating teaching to meet the needs of different students. The other day I was working a MLC shift and one of my fellow student teachers was observing me, and when we reflected on the experience, one of the key things that came out of it was the ability to rapidly switch mindset between talking to a third year pure maths student talking about topology and category theory, to a first year student struggling with rearranging an equation --- a valuable skill that I have not always had, but have managed to improve on dramatically over the years of working at the MLC. Maybe I should write a post about this explicitly, but for now I suppose <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-02-mlc-slack-post %}">my slack channel post</a> will have to do as far as evidence of this goes. I also think the unit plans I constructed as part of the C&M courses, for both <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-30-chem-topic-folio %}">chemistry</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-23-maths-unit-plan %}">maths</a>, demonstrate some strategies for differentiation, allowing students who are bored to get ahead, while leaving time for me to spend more time with, and provide more resources for, the students who are struggling.</p>
		
		<p><strong>What this standard means to me:</strong> </p>
		
		<p><strong>Relevant experiences, qualifications, and evidence of meeting this standard:</strong> 
		<ul>			
			<li>When I began the probability topic with my year 10 maths classes at NMHS, I used a pre-test as a formative diagnostic assessment in which I had them self-assess using solutions to determine how much of the probability topic they could remember from previous years. I intended to use this assessment to determine how much detail I should go through the revision material, how quickly to move onto the new material, and which specific concepts I should spend more time on and explain in greater detail. However I got much more than that out of it. I identified different groups of students in the class who needed different things, and differences between the two classes of year 10s I was teaching. Specifically, one class had more than 7 international/ english as an additional language students, and needed more help understanding the english involved in worded questions, although once they understood what a question was asking they could answer it quite well. So for that class, I incorporated a focus on highlighting how to identify key terms in questions that would help in figuring out what the questions where asking, and I maintained this focus throughout the topic. Across both classes, I also identified groups of students who needed more extension activities, as those students had already mastered the basic skills and would otherwise be bored during the topic. So for those students, I prepared additional extension. Evidence for each of these points is presented in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-29-week-4-maths %}">my reflections on week 4 with these classes</a>. </li>
			
			<li>The activity I ran with my year 10 maths classes at NMHS during <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-06-first-lesson %}">my very first lessons with them</a> was a group based activity in which they needed a reasonable degree of social interaction and cooperation with each other. This went really well for many students, but certain students where very reluctant to participate and it was my assessment that their learning was being hindered by their reluctance to participate in social and group work. Ultimately I would have wanted to help them develop these social skills and confidence through carefully engaging them with the rest of the class in safe, low pressure environments and activities. However in the limited time I had with them I used this formative assessment to determine that it would beneficial to offer alternatives to group work for the time being as well --- to give them choice, and the option to learn according to their strengths. To this end, later on in the unit when I introduced another group activity I included alternative individual work they could do instead. For evidence of this, see the last section of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-13-bhs-data %}"> my reflection on week 3 at NMHS</a>, which is when I introduced this differentiation.</li>
			
			<li>At BHS I took the opportunity to try and take differentiation to a new level with the indices topic as I had the class for the whole topic and I had been given a lot of freedom from my mentor teacher about how to teach it. I tried alot of different things, all with a focus on differentiation, and some turned out more successful than others. For evidence and artefacts from this unit see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-06-bhs-10-maths-indices %}">my reflection on the indices topic</a>. Some of the differentiation-focused choices I made when planning the unit included:
			<ul>
				<li></li>
				<li></li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>
			
			<li>Treating each student as an individual is core to my teaching philosophy, and as such one-on-one interactions with students forms a core basis for my teaching practice. As such, differentiation is a natural and integral part of every single lesson I teach, through informal formative assessment through discussions with students, and tailored support given to each individual student.</li>

		<p><strong>What this standard means to me:</strong> Assessment serves many important roles in teaching and learning, and this concept has been an overarching theme for my whole Master of Teaching program right from one of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-24-validity %}">initial assignments to reflect on this fact</a>, right up to recognising the importance of assessment in my placements. In my practice I rely heavily on formative, informal, and diagnostic assessments to tailor my teaching to the level of the students and differentiate between the needs of different students. However, I also recognise the importance of formal summative assessment in its role in reporting, but also in its role in motivating students due to its role in reporting.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Relevant experiences, qualifications, and evidence of meeting this standard:</strong> 
		<ul>
			<li>Aside from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-24-validity %}">initial assignment mentioned above</a>, there were several other assignments that directly addressed the issue of the role of assessment as part of the coursework for the Master of Teaching program. Specifically, a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-04-assessment_of_as_for_learning %}">discussion/ comparison of assessment of vs. as vs. for learning</a>, and an assignment on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-14-getting-feedback %}">getting feedback using ICT</a>.</li>
			
			<li>When I began the probability topic with my year 10 maths class, I used a pre-test as a formative diagnostic assessment in which I had them self-assess using solutions to determine how much of the probability topic they could remember from previous years. I used this assessment to determine how much detail I should go through the revision material, how quickly to move onto the new material, and which specific concepts I should spend more time on and explain in greater detail. See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-29-week-4-maths %}">my reflections in this post</a>, which contains numerous items of evidence. </li>
			
			<li>I've also delivered, marked (with the help of internal moderation with my mentor teachers), and reported on several formal summative assessment items, including:

			<li>As part of the coursework component of the Master of Teaching program I also participated in several mock moderation activities that where actually very beneficial in terms of better understanding the moderation process, and benchmarking my expectations for the standard of work from different students.

			<li>During a staff meeting in my second placement I had the opportunity to help prepare some graphs of student achievement data over the past 4 years at the school to highlight trends and spark discussion amongst staff. During the same staff meeting, I also had the opportunity to participate in a professional development unit focused literacy and numeracy strategies, for which I got <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/placement/bhs/data_analysis_PD.pdf.pdf">a certificate of participation</a>. I also wrote <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-13-bhs-data %}">a short reflection</a> on my contribution to this analysis of student data.</li>
			
			<li>The activity I ran with my year 10 maths classes at NMHS during <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-06-first-lesson %}">my very first lessons with them</a> was a group based activity in which they needed a reasonable degree of social interaction and cooperation with each other. This went really well for many students, but certain students where very reluctant to participate and it was my assessment that their learning was being hindered by their relucance to participate in social and group work. Ultimately I would have wanted to help them develop these social skills and confidence through carefully engaging them with the rest of the class in safe, low pressure environments and activities. However in the limited time I had with them I used this formative assessment to determine that it would beneficial to offer alternatives to group work for the time being as well --- to give them choice, and the option to learn according to their strengths. To this end, later on in the unit when I introduced another group activity I included alternative individual work they could do instead. For evidence of this, see the last section of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-13-bhs-data %}"> my reflection on week 3 at NMHS</a>, which is when I introduced this differentiation.</li>
			
			<li>When I began the probability topic with my year 10 maths classes at NMHS, I used a pre-test as a formative diagnostic assessment in which I had them self-assess using solutions to determine how much of the probability topic they could remember from previous years. I used this assessment to determine how much detail I should go through the revision material, how quickly to move onto the new material, and which specific concepts I should spend more time on and explain in greater detail. Specifically, there where two major modifications to my teaching plan I incorporated as a result of this assessment: for some students, particularly international and english as an additional language students, I incorporated a focus on highlighting how to identify key terms in questions that would help in figuring out what the questions where asking, and I maintained this focus throughout the topic. THe second modification I made was incorporating more extension activities for those students who had already mastered the basic skills and would otherwise be bored during the topic. Evidence for each of these points is presented in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-29-week-4-maths %}">my reflections on week 4 with these classes</a>. </li>
			
			<li>In my year 10 science class, I marked their <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-20-inertia-report-marking %}">inertia practical reports</a> and from this assessment item I identified some key gaps the students had in their knowledge, both around variables (dependant, independant, constant), and graphs. So the following week, when introducing them to their next practical, I modified my teaching plan to include additional time and explanations of these concepts before moving forward, and emphasised applying these concepts in the next practical to help them solidify their understanding. In terms of variables I went through this with the whole class as most of them had struggled with it, but with graphs it was a select group of 4 or 5 students who seem to just have had that gap in their knowledge, so while the class was beginning to work on writing up their prac reports for the next prac I took those students aside and ran a mini-tutorial for them on constructing graphs to give them some extra support, which they responded very well too. This is shown in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-29-week-4-science %}">my reflections on that week with the class</a>.</li>
