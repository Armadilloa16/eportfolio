Thursday was a day off for the year 10 students, so I didn't teach any classes, but today was a full day of teaching, I had 5 consecutive periods of teaching, a single of science, and then two doubles of maths. Luckily the two classes of maths were nicely synced at the same point so I could do the same less
on with both of them. 

I did lesson plans for these as well, both [for science]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/lessons/20180608/080618_lesson4_plan.pdf) and [for maths]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/lessons/20180608/080618_lesson56-78_plan.pdf), but much like before, I ended up changing the plan before I delivered the class and never updated the lesson plans. I think that from now on I will stop bothering to do lesson plans (although I will continue to plan lessons). My impression is that lesson plans may hold some value in terms of helping structure thinking about timings (how long certain things will take, planning for transitions that may occur, etc), but that the important thing to do is to *plan lessons*, not to write lesson plans.

## Period 4: Science

In science I spoke a little about conservation of energy, and introduced the concept of gravitational potential energy, I then showed [this video](https://youtu.be/PWNs7i4rEWA) (which went down very well). I then gave the class the rest of the lesson to work on their summative prac report.

## Periods 5-6: Maths

I gave the students their summative task for topic, a directed investigation on movie ratings to be collected from imdb. I showed them how to collect the data, and then went through a little on how to do the necessary calculations for the assignment. 

## Periods 7-8: Maths

Being able to deliver essentially the same lesson again immediately was so helpful, and I think I did a much better job this time. See the worked example below, which I provided to the students through Day Map for later reference as well.

## Feedback

At the end of the day my mentor gave me three pages of feedback on the classes I taught today, including the same note I made above (that the second maths lesson was much improved over the first) and many other things. However similar to the other time I won't include his feedback here as it includes explicit reference to specific students by name.
