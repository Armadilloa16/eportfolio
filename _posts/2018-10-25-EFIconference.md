This started as a post just for the Abstract submission, but then I updated it to include all the conference related materials. Apart from [the research paper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-11-14-dyslexia %}), the conference and the work associated to it formed the remainder of the assessment for the course "Education for Inclusion" (EFI).

## Abstract

The first assignment for the subject was to write an abstract for a conference presentation.

Here is [a pdf version of the submitted abstract]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/EFIconference/presentation/Abstract.pdf), and [a .docx version with some extra notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/EFIconference/presentation/Abstract.docx).


## Slides

Here are my slides for the presentation, [as pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/EFIconference/presentation/Slides.pdf) and [as .pptx]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/EFIconference/presentation/Slides.pptx), even though the slides I actually presented off where google slides it's easier to guarantee link stability if I upload them this way rather than link to the google drive.


## Conference Contribution

Afterwards, we had to write a short description of our contribution to the conference organisation etc. Here is what I wrote:

<blockquote markdown="1">
My biggest contribution to the conference was probably typesetting the booklet. It was a highly collaborative role, where essentially I had to take the work done by many other people and arrange it all to fit together nicely, and add in little bits and pieces to make it flow together as a single whole. I worked with the proofreaders who proofread abstracts in amazing time for me, with David who helped organise deadlines and timeframes, with Di who helped with sending out the final email with the booklet to all those who registers, and many others as well. A big part of it was incorporating very valuable feedback, which I did several rounds of. One of the neat suggestions that came out of this was hyperlinking the names of presenters in the program to their abstracts… this was suggested in feedback, and it was a great idea (although in hindsight organising the program was actually a huge amount of work, partly because Matt Bailey never got back to me about it… so me and David had to sort it all out at the last second with Eliza, and that actually ended up being a fair amount of work.

Aside from my work on the booklet, I contributed to discussions in meetings, I even I took the minutes once. I also contributed to the catering by asking David Butler from the Maths Learning Centre if I could borrow their tray of mugs so we wouldn’t have to use disposable styrofoam cups. This also meant I cleaned the mugs after each day at the conference. I don’t feel like I really did all that much, but in hindsight looking at it objectively I guess I did at least 10 hours of work just on the booklet… Still, doesn’t feel like that much.

## Booklet

Given how writing the booklet was probably my largest contribution to the conference, I figured I would include it here. The [final compiled pdf version]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/EFIconference/booklet/booklet.pdf), but also [all the source .tex, images, graphics, and materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/EFIconference/booklet/).

## Certificate

We also produced a PD certificate of participation for everyone, and [I got one of course]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/EFIconference/certificate.pdf).
