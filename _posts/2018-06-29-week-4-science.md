I liked the format of my week 3 reflections, so I though I would keep it for my week 4 reflections, it allowed for good discussion flow as it focused on subject areas separately across the week. 

## Monday Double

Having marked their [Inertia Prac Reports]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-20-inertia-report-marking %}) last weekend, I gave some feedback on which points people needed to improve on most. This included in particular a focus on variables:

![Constant, Independant, Dependant Variables]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/photos/boardwork/20180628-variables.jpg)

and I also went through briefly how to decide on which kinds of graph to construct: for two numeric variables make a scatterplot, for one numeric and one categorical make a bar chart. I then introduced the [bouncing balls prac]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/resources/Bouncing_balls_prac_report_task_sheet.pdf) and gave them the rest of the class to design how they wanted to conduct it: to choose their variables, and write their aim/hypothesis, materials, and method. 

One student in particular came up with a completely original idea of testing the efficiency of a ball, then inflating it and testing it again to investigate the effect of inflating it which I thought was brilliant so I organised to get a ball pump for her to use in the following class.



## Thursday Double

I [planned Thursdays double]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/lesson_plans/20180628_lesson12_plan.pdf), started the session by showing the class an example of how to calculate efficiency:

![Calculating Efficiency]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/photos/boardwork/20180628-efficiency.jpg)

and then, after making clear some rules (no throwing the balls, etc.), let them start the bouncing balls prac. I had some printed copies of the  [scaffolding document]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/resources/Bouncing_balls_prac_report_scaffold.pdf) ready for anyone who struggled. A few groups asked for the scaffold, but not all. The inflation version of the prac went perfectly.




## Friday Single

I [planned Friday single]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/lesson_plans/20180629_lesson4_plan.pdf), and had one or two groups having to repeat or complete their prac, but otherwise got everyone writing up their prac reports, and they made good progress on them.
