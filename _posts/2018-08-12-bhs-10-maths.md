# Week 4

We started off with some basic worksheets to practice using the concepts around index laws, and I produced some extention activities for those students already on top of the algebra who would be bored. One of the students took this extension activity and knocked it out of the park, showing me a construction I had never seen before.

# Week 5

In week 5 my mentor teacher along with a sizable portion of the class were away on a week long ski trip excursion. The week started low with a lesson in which the class was very unenthused. So I decided to introduce them to a concept I personally love: silver rhombic dodecahedra, which was a big hit. I even linked it to some index laws with derviving the silver ratio for A-sized paper, and talking about other similar derivations for golden ratioed rectangles. I also continued other students on alternative extention activities. I didn't want to move too far ahead with indices while some of the class were away.
Jason away on Ski Trip, did dodecahedra, ups and downs, etc.

# Week 6

Mentor teacher and students returned from ski trip. Did crash course on indices for those that were away on ski trip, pushed others to try formative investigation that a few students had gotten some valuble learning out of. Meanwhile, we developed the index law test, and decided to give the students an option to choose between either doing the test, or a directed investigation in the same class. Over both weeks 5 and 6, I had the students very split up with different groups working on different things, trying to tailor to each students interests. It worked, to some degree. There was a group of students who where uncomfortable with the unorthodox activities and who would have been much more comfortable simply doing textbook questions... but I think it was still good to push them out of their comfort zone.
