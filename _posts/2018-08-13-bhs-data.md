Today BHS had their regular staff meeting. Earlier in the week one of my mentor teachers (who is in leadership) was working on making some graphics of student achievement to prompt some discussion in todays staff meeting. Given my background is specifically in data analysis and the graphical representations of data I offered to help with making some graphics. I did this, but I don't think I should include the graphics here as they contain potentially confidential information. They where lovely to provide me with [a certificate to thank me for my contribution]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/placement/bhs/data_analysis_PD.pdf) however.
