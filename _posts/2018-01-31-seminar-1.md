The Seminar 1 task was to upload the APST, the SACE course outlines for my relevant specialisation areas, to read two papers {% cite Black2010 %} and {% cite Masters2014 %} and Chapter 2 of the {% cite Churchill2013 %} textbook, and write a reflection responding to the question "From your experience of Seminar 1, and reading Chpt. 2, what historical features do you see as influencing the current SACE curriculum?".

I've uploaded the APST [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/APST.pdf), and linked them on the [Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link apst.html %}) page as well.

I've uploaded the SACE course outlines for Chemistry:

 - [Stage 1 Chemistry]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/2018Stage1Chemistry.pdf)
 - [Stage 2 Chemistry]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/2018Stage2Chemistry.pdf)

and for Mathematics:

 - [Stage 1 Essential Mathematics]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/2018Stage1EssentialMathematics.pdf)
 - [Stage 1 General Mathematics]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/2018Stage1GeneralMathematics.pdf)
 - [Stage 1 Mathematics]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/2018Stage1Mathematics.pdf)
 - [Stage 2 Essential Mathematics]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/2018Stage2EssentialMathematics.pdf)
 - [Stage 2 General Mathematics]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/2018Stage2GeneralMathematics.pdf)
 - [Stage 2 Mathematical Methods]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/2018Stage2MathematicalMethods.pdf)
 - [Stage 2 Specialist Mathematics]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/SACE/2018Stage2SpecialistMathematics.pdf)

First, I read the two papers, the {% cite Masters2014 %} paper could be summarised by making the point that although assessment can be viewed from many different perspectives and in many different contexts, its purpose is always the same:

{% quote Masters2014 %}
The fundamental purpose of assessment in education is to establish and understand where learners are in an aspect of their learning at the time of assessment.
{% endquote %}

According to {% cite Masters2014 %} there has been a great deal of division and argument in the education academia about various perspectives on assessment, which is appropriate in a given context and which is not and so on, and {% cite Masters2014 %} calls for some unity from the community, a banding together and a recognition that despite our differences and disagreements at the end of the day we are all trying to acheive the same goals.

The {% cite Black2010 %} paper talked about the crucial step in improvement of the education system of considering what happens "Inside the Black Box" of the classroom. The major focus was on how although overarching teaching theory and policy can be useful, it often overlooks the crucial step of implementation in the classroom and that more attention should be spent on that step, as it is ultimately the step that will have impact.

I'm still reading Chapter 2 of {% cite Churchill2013 %} and when I'm done I'll update this post with my reflections.

Writing this post also served to help me learn how to implement a number of things in jekyll/ markdown including uploading/ linking files, citations, etc. so in that sense it also contributed to my learning experience. Lifelong learning, as they say, and loving it.
