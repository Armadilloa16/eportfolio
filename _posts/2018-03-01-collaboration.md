In this task we where briefly introduced to a number of different ICT tools that could be used for collaboration, cooperation, and sharing:
- Shared Notes/ Documents using Google Docs.
- Shared Teaching using Teaching Tour
- Shared Experience --- Gelatissimo Excursion
- Making podcasts using Podsmash

We also talked about adaptive talking and stages of the flipped classroom, and compared Cooperative ("Sage on the Stage") and Collaborative ("Guide on the Side") teaching.

In the shared google docs file I posted the following:

I came across this example from science awhile back, which I think is fantastic:

And for maths I came across the awesome puzzle: Make me a right angle triangle using a piece of string and NOTHING ELSE. Both really nice puzzles.

We had three questions to reflect and post responses too, these are included in my post to the discussion board, which follows:

<blockquote markdown="1">

**Question 1: Collaboration WITHOUT technology?**

I would pose a question that requires some exploration or discovery to solve, and encourage the class to discuss amongst themselves and share insights in order to make progress, probably in small groups. For example, I might construct something [like this](https://youtu.be/ClmtcwfWI6M) to illustrate how observations and theories interact in scientific processes. If they are struggling, I might ask them more and more leading questions, or offer them some suggestions for directions/ experiments they might like to take/ do. 

**Question 2: Collaboration WITH technology?**

Again, to me the essence of a collaborative task is to encourage peer-to-peer discussion amongst the students. To achieve this I like the idea of using open ended questions and tasks, and example from a recent lesson plan I made for senior maths would be I would give them a link to [this GeoGebra worksheet](https://ggbm.at/kpREkaRQ) I made, and get them to come up with some guesses as to what properties angles in circles might have based on playing with the interactive animations. Again, I might get them to share an iPad between a group or in pairs and have them discuss between themselves what they think, then share with the class. Later we would go through the guesses and explore them in more detail with some guidance from the teacher (me). 

**Question 3: Feedback?**

The popping in the audio in the first few videos was abit unpleasent. There were also one or two places where you could tell the videos where not recorded this year, because of references to things that hadn't happened or something. I can't remember a specific example for the life of me, but I remember noticing something like that in one of the earlier videos.
