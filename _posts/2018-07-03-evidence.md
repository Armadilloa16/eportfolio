I thought it might be useful to catalog all the evidence I collected from my NMHS placement, put it in one place, and maybe map it to the APST so I could evaluate if my current process will be sufficient, and if not where I should focus my efforts/ what I should change in my second placement to make sure I cover my bases. From a review of all the evidence I collected on placement, there are five clear categories of evidence: 
 - Lesson Plans, 
 - Resources (mostly worksheets, and a few presentations, videos, etc.).
 - Photos (mostly of boardwork, and a few of handwritten notes). 
 - Feedback (from my mentor teacher or relief teachers taking my mentor teachers role)
 - Student work (mostly in the form of summative assignments).
 
The first three are all up on my eportfolio (in previous posts), for a complete list see below in the appropriate sections. But the last two: Feedback, and student work, both contain sensitive details (mostly student names), and so are not available currently. I need to evaluate if these are important pieces of evidence, and if they are I will have to anonymise them before posting them to my eportfolio.
