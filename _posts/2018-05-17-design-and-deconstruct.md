We where set [a task]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/deconstructPrac/ChemistryCurriculumandMethodologyInvestigationsFolioDeconstructDesignTask18.pdf) to make a deconstruct and design prac suitable for a stage 2 SACE chemistry class, along with a risk assessment for it. We were given [an outline of the SACE assessment requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/deconstructPrac/ChemistryCurriculumandMethodologyDeconstructDesignOutlineC&M18.pdf), and [an example of a deconstruct and design prac]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/chemIntensive/deconstructPrac/Stg2ChemDeconstructionInvestigationAnalysisofAnalgesicsC&M18.pdf). 

Because I missed the second day of the intensive, instead of making my own prac Glen invited me to come work with him on the prac he was planning for his students. Because it's a live prac I'll omit links to the files for now.

TODO: Tag this assignment with relevant APST standards.
