  <h1>Personal Statement</h1>

  <p>I aspire to be the kind of teacher that creates a safe environment in which students can interact and learn. <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-4">APST 4</a>)--> I think achieving this goal will be a lifelong journey, and not an easy one. It will involve constant learning, <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-1">APST 1</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-2">APST 2</a>)--> development <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-6">APST 6</a>)--> and improvement on my part. I also acknowledge that indepth student feedback <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-5">APST 5</a>)--> is crucial for supporting learning, and I aim to focus on transparency as both a method for providing feedback, but also as what I believe to be good practice for demonstrating integrity and supporting collaboration. I hope that through transparency I can also encourage feedback in the other direction --- encouraging students, parents, and my peers to suggest how they think I can improve. I expect interaction with collegues, parents, students, and the community at large <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-7">APST 7</a>)--> to provide some of the most useful pieces of information towards continual improvement as a teacher, which is my day-to-day goal even while my ultimate goal remains to create a safe environment in which students can interact and learn. </p>

  <p>I have had many influences on my perspective of the role of a teacher, an influence was "Dont assume"</p>

  
	<p>My philosophy of teaching - what kind of teacher am I/do I want to be and why? What is the role of a teacher in the process of learning?</p>

  <p>Since 2011 I have been working as a tutor at the Maths Learning Centre at the University of Adelaide, where I developed a love for helping people find the joy in mathematics. My journey towards becoming a teacher was long and full of detours, first pursuing a PhD in statistics (bioinformatics), then working as a postdoctoral research assistant for several years. When I finally decided to leave professional science to become a teacher, I knew I had found my passion.</p> 

  <p>Along the way I have been inspired by many people. Dan Kortchak helped me learn that thinking about problems from the perspective of a systems engineer as opposed to that of a mathematician, and helped me explore the differences. The writing of Paul Halmos inspired me with it's concise eloquence. But most of all the enthusiasm and pedagogy of David Butler's teaching practice at the Maths Learning Centre truely inspired me to be a better teacher.</p>
