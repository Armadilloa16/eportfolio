Today I had a double of maths, I had made [a lesson plan]({{ site.baseurl }}//files/placement/nmhs/lesson_plans/20180613_lesson56_plan.pdf), but as usual didn't really stick to it. 
Having given [two lessons last Friday, and with the picture I put up on Day Map of the worked example]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-08-full-day-of-teaching %}), in this class I found that one of the things people were struggling with was the median calculation. So I gave a more detailed worked example of that calculation, with a scaffolding structure for how to perform the calculation:
