Today BHS had their regular staff meeting, in which the focus was student mental health, wellbeing and support. They later gave me [a certificate for my participation]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/placement/bhs/mental_health_PD.pdf). This was the first mention of an ongoing and visible effort being made by the school to support and emphasise the importance of mental health of both students and staff. This was a movement which I was strongly supportive of. Later in the term the school had a mental health expo on a casual day for the students, and I spent a few hours helping out at the beyond blue stall with a few of the students from my year 11 chemistry class:
