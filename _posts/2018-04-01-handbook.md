TODO: Posted at due date.

We where tasked to create a handbook of classroom management strategies for Student Teacher in the Classroom (STiC), [the instructions and rubric are available]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/handbook/STiCassignment1.pdf). There is also a wealth of resources on the MyUni page, including:
- A list of videos used in lectures
- Key points to focus on when making the handbook
- Examples of handbooks from previous years
- Numerous figures and lists of resources for strategies, theorists, and theories.
