I listened to an interesting webinar from the SSA by Emi Tanaka on their development of a package for the grammar of design of experiments. The talk was interesting, but in particular I think Emi Tanaka is a person to keep an eye on as we seem to have some common interests.

The [slides are available on their website](https://emitanaka.org/slides/SSA2020/#1).
