  Welcome! My name is Lyron Winderbaum and I have been called a statistician, mathematician, and scientist but I am now a pre-service teacher. This site is my teaching e-portfolio, and it is organised under the following three headings:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog"><strong>Reflections:</strong></a> contain posts and reflections in a blog-style presentation. This includes all my personal and professional development, examples of teaching practice, and my personal reflections. The material here can be sorted and organized by various tags to find specific things, and it's primary purpose is to document evidence towards the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/APST.pdf">Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST)</a>.
    <li> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst"><strong>Standards:</strong></a> A list of all 37 <a href="https://www.aitsl.edu.au/teach/standards">Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL)</a> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/APST.pdf">Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST)</a>, each with a short discussion/ reflection and links to evidence and reflections.
    <li> <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/"><strong>About me:</strong></a> Information about me, my teaching philosophy, my professional (and personal) history, and the organisation structure of my e-portfolio.
  </ul>
    
  The information on this "About me" page is organised under the following headings:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="#statement"><strong>Personal Teaching Statement:</strong></a> My perspective of teaching, the role of a teacher, and the kind of teacher I aspire to be. </li>
    <li> <a href="#background"><strong>Short History:</strong></a> Where I am from and how I came to be a teacher.</li>
	<li> <a href="#influences"><strong>Influences and Hobbies:</strong></a> Some deeper insight into the people and things that have influenced me, as well as some details of my ``extra-curricular'' interests. </li>
    <li> <a href="#cv"><strong>R&eacutesumâ€Œ&eacute:</strong></a> A concise summary of my qualifications, skills and professional employment history. </li>
  </ul>


  
  <h1 id="statement">Personal Teaching Statement</h1>
	
  This personal statement is organised under three main APST headings. For previous versions of my personal statement written in different formats and with different foci, see below.
  
  <h2>Professional Knowledge</h2>
  
  <img src="files/photos/chemistry.jpg" alt="Movember2017" hspace="20" style="float:left;width:240px">  
  
  <p>Knowing our students is fundamental to being able to tailor our teaching to their particular needs, preferences, culture, and language. I get to know my students building relationships and rapport with students so that they feel comfortable communicating with me frankly. I use this communication to adjust and differentiate my teaching to be appropriate to the specific students, and to determine their current stage in learning by this informal, formative assessment approach. For example when I was teaching year 10 mathematics at NMHS I had two classes, one of which enjoyed group work and the other less so. In particular, although several students enjoyed it a few expressed feelings of discomfort at being required to complete work in small groups. In response to this feedback, I adjusted the next task I gave both classes, offering them a choice between two activities, one being a group task and the other individual. In one class, most of the class opted into the group work, while in the other class most opted for individual work. The students expressed their gratitude for being given the option, but beyond that some of the students who struggled to meet a passing grade in the first task, excelled when given the choice to work individually thereby demonstrating the impact of tailoring the methods to cater to their preferred method of learning.</p>

  <p>Knowing the content allows for us to place the learning into a larger context, giving it more authenticity and making it more engaging for our students. It also allows us to be aware of the potential future problems students may encounter and equip them to face those challenges appropriately. Because of my experience as a professional statistician, I can share my experiences with my students to explain to them where in the real world these skills can be used, and why they are important in an authentic way. For example, when I was teaching stage 2 mathematical methods at BHS I had a student ask me how p-value cutoffs where determined and if they where always the same, so I told them a story about the process by which we would determine the cutoff in a medical decision making process involving endometrial cancer --- based on weighing up the consequences of being wrong in either case. The students listened with rapt attention, at least partly because they knew it was a true story, and it was a real example of statistics having a life and death impact on many patients lives. When teaching stage 1 chemistry at BHS I was acutely aware that when students went on to study in stage 2 and first year university, many of the theories I was teaching them would be replaced with more complex models, and that many students often struggle with frustration over being taught "wrong" models previously. As such, I adjusted my teaching to make sure I mentioned that there where a sequence of models we use in chemistry, each in the sequence explaining more about the observations we make, but that the ultimate scientific "litmus test" was always observation, not theory. If a theory makes a prediction, and you observe something that contradicts the theories prediction there is nothing to be done --- the theory is wrong. Students appreciated this perspective of science as we moved through the unit, matching their experimental observations to the theory, and they appreciated being told that later on in their learning journey they would be exposed to observations that would contradict the current models, and so they would have to discard the current theory in favour of new, more complex, theories that explained their new observations.</p>
  
  <h2>Professional Practice</h2>
  
  <img src="files/photos/movember2017.jpg" alt="Movember2017" hspace="20" style="float:right;width:220px">  
    
  <p>Central to my teaching ideology is to recognise each individual students unique strengths, and to encourage the development of relationships based on mutual respect of each others unique strengths. In my practice I always look out for unique learning opportunities to encourage student participation. For example, in my year 10 science class at NMHS I introduced a summative practical: to bounce balls in an investigation of the law of conservation of energy. When first introducing the class I left determination of the independent variables for the experiment deliberately vague, and instructed the students to come up with some on their own instead of giving them the scaffolding document in which it was suggested that different types of balls be used and dropped from different heights as the two independent variables. Some students struggled, and for those I had some copies of the scaffolding document on hand to help them along, but introducing the task in this way gave other students the opportunities to suggest different variables, not suggested in the scaffolding document. One student in particular came up with the idea of using a slightly deflated beachball or soccerball, and then inflating it to see the difference inflation made. This was particularly notable because this student had not been particularly engaged in class, and had had middling academic success in the previous term showing consistent disinterest in class up until this point. But when I came to the next class with a pump, ready to test their idea they immediately engaged with the task, was completely self-driven, and produced an excellent prac report to describe it. Allowing students to engage with material and make it their own can engage students that might otherwise be disinterested and this was one of the most valuable memories I took from practicum. Using open ended questions in this way to engage students in work by giving them a degree of ownership over it is one of my favoured techniques, as it also allows students to self-asses and determine their own problem to solve to a degree, and so the difficulty of the problem is also partly in their control. Another example of my using this technique was in my year 10 mathematics class at BHS, I offered a two-stage choice for the assessment of the indices unit: first, students could sit either a fairly standard test, or they could choose to attempt a more open-ended directed investigation. Second, in the investigation the final section involved them constructing their own problem to solve, and so they could determine their own difficulty level --- some chose to construct a problem that was easy to solve (which is a high-level thinking skill in and of itself), others chose to challenge themselves and deliberately constructed a problem that was difficult to solve. Giving the students choice in this way allowed the students to tailor their own learning experience, and choose assessment in this case that was more inline with their own learning styles and preferences.</p>
  
  <p>For students to learn and excel they need to feel comfortable and safe. As such, an affective approach to student wellbeing is crucial. By producing an environment in which students can feel safe, I can help them to discover their strengths and excel. I do this primarily by building relationships with my students. This is a subtle process that takes some time, but gradually trust is developed and through that I can gain some insight into how my students are feeling and make adjustments to the classroom environment in order to help them feel more comfortable. For example, in one of my classes I ran an activity in which I taught the class how to fold A4 paper into silver rhombic dodecahedra and had them investigate the properties of this shape. The process of folding the paper is quite therapeutic, and as I ran this activity after already having had the class for a few weeks and having established relationships with them enough that they felt comfortable coming up to me and telling about their feelings, one student came up to me after class and admitted that she had been suffering from severe anxiety and that had been the reason that she had missed alot of classes but that folding the paper rhombic units had actually helped her feel a lot more comfortable in class. As a result I modified the classroom environment the next week by putting a stack of paper in the corner of the class and informing the class that if anyone was feeling overwhelmed or anxious during class that they could move over into the corner and fold some rhombic units for dodecahedra as a calming exercise. Several students beyond the original one who had come to talk to me took advantage of this corner in the weeks to follow, and several of them told me about how it had helped them calm down after having had some pretty severely traumatic events outside of the class. Some of these students attendance rates also improved after this. Its in ways like this that I aim to create a safe environment in which my students can feel comfortable and productive. If students are in an uncomfortable environment or feel unsafe it is completely unreasonable to expect them to be able to learn, so as teachers providing a safe environment for our students has to be one of our highest priorities, not just because without that it would be impossible for our students to learn, but because everybody deserves to feel safe. It is literally in the international bill of human rights.</p>

  <h2>Professional Engagement</h2>
  
  <p>Learning is a passion of mine, and I have never stopped learning at any point during my life. Through discussion with colleagues and self-reflection I identify my weaknesses and areas of ignorance, and constantly work to better myself and improve. I particularly benefit from open discussions with colleagues who hold very different views/ beliefs and use very different teaching methods to me, as this is when I learn the most. For example on my placement to BHS, one of my mentor teachers had a very different teaching style to mine. Through discussions with her and with the students I gained alot of insight into how there truely is no single best teaching style, there is simply teaching styles that better suit certain students, and teaching styles that better suit different teachers. I learnt that there is alot of value in learning from teachers with different teaching styles than your own, because pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone and learning these different skills can be incredibly valuable with faced with students who do not respond to your preferred style. Professional development is always a pleasure for me, and while I was at BHS and they had a numeracy focused professional development day I offered to take a workshop on probabiltiy and share my expertise with the rest of the staff. I even had one staff member approach me several days later and thank me, because she had apparently suffered from severe maths anxiety, having a minor panic attack on the morning of the PD day because she realised it would have a numeracy focus, but she said that the workshop I ran had opened her eyes to the possibility that maths might not actually be all that scary and more connected to concepts with which she felt comfortable than she had previously realised. I was very proud of her, and I only wish I could bring experiences like that to more people.</p>
 
 <h2> Previous Personal Statements </h2>
 
 Below is a list of previous personal statements I have written Many of these are written from different perspectives and with a focus on different aspects of my teaching practice, so they can give a deeper insight into my teaching philosophy. This is often reflected by how they are structured and what headings they are organised under. Also, these can give an idea of how my teaching philosphy has evolved over time and become more detailed as I have accrued experiences and reflected on my teaching.

 <ul>
	<li> Initially I wrote <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-04-08-personal-statement %}">a personal statement based on my core values</a>. </li>
	
	<li>After my teaching practicum experience as part of the Master of Teaching program, I then re-wrote a personal statement that was more focused on specific examples of my practice, and was organised under the three main APST headings.</li>
 </ul>
  

  <h1 id="background">Short History</h1>

  <p>I was born in Jerusalem, Israel, in 1989. My family moved to Australia in 1992, when I was three years old, and since then I grew up in the Adelaide hills until I moved out of home into the inner suburbs in 2007. After graduating highschool in 2006 I went straight to university, studying a Bachelor of Science. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do yet exactly, but I knew that whatever it was it would be somewhere in the Science/ Maths areas. I changed my mind about what I wanted to major in every year of my undergraduate degree, finally graduating in 2010 with three majors: Chemistry, Pure Mathematics, and Statistics.</p>
    
  <img src="files/photos/brainrack.jpg" alt="Brainrack" hspace="20" style="float:left;width:300px">

  <p>In 2011 I started (and completed) an honours degree through the School of Mathematical Sciences in the discipline of statistics, working on a project analysing LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) geochemical data from pyrite sections under the supervision of Associate Professor Andrew Metcalfe. At the same time (also in 2011) I started teaching at the University of Adelaide: tutoring, marking, and demonstrating through the School of Mathematical Sciences, and also through the Maths Learning Centre --- where I developed a love for helping people find the joy in mathematics. Together with Dr. David Butler and a few other people we coined a term for this, ``mathefreude'', which we later discovered is actually already a word (which is awesome, by the way). Working in the Maths Learning Centre is also when the seeds where first planted that would later grow into my passion for teaching, although I don't think I was fully aware of that at the time.</p> 
  
  <p>In 2012 I continued my trajectory into academia, beginning my PhD project on ``The Statistical Analysis of Proteomics Imaging Mass Spectrometry Data'' under the supervision of Associate Professor Inge Koch, which I worked on until it was accepted for the degree in 2016. During that time interspersed between my PhD candidature I worked as a research assistant, but also continued teaching. I eventually dropped the teaching work through the School of Mathematical Sciences, but continuing to work at the Maths Learning Centre throughout.</p>
  
  <img src="files/photos/Conways_tangles.jpg" alt="Conway's Tangles" hspace="20" style="float:right;width:300px">

  <p> After I completed my PhD I continued working in the field as a postdoctoral research assistant for over a year (including all of 2017). At the beginning of 2017 I was asked to take on a full time research position at the University of Adelaide, which I initially accepted, but as a consequence I had to give up on teaching through the Maths Learning Centre. It was during this time that I realised the importance teaching had grown to have for me. I was unhappy in academia and I missed teaching. I starting going into the Maths Learning Centre and helping students there in my free time, on my lunch breaks and so on. It was then that I realised... if there is a job that I enjoy so much that I would volunteer to go and do it in my free time... that is probably what I should be doing with my life. Even having this realisation, changing direction is difficult, careers seem to have momentum and they pull you along with them. Initially I only took a half-step towards teaching, asking to go down to a part-time load of research so that I could start teaching again because of my realisation of its importance to me. This satisfied me for a time, but when my research funding ran out at the end of 2017 I realised it was an opportunity to focus all my time and efforts on my passion, and so I enrolled in the Master of Teaching program. </p>

  <h1 id="influences">Influences and Hobbies</h1>
  
  <img src="files/photos/shedidit.jpg" alt="Shedidit" hspace="20" style="float:left;width:240px">

  <p>Along the way I have been inspired by many people. Dan Kortschak inspired me to think about problems from the perspective of a systems or software engineer and not just that of a mathematician. The writing of Paul Halmos, first recommended to me by my PhD supervisor Inge, inspired me to be a better communicator with it's concise eloquence. But most of all the enthusiasm and pedagogy of David Butler's teaching practice at the Maths Learning Centre truely inspired me to be a better teacher.</p>

  <p>Brendan Bentley once said in the first intensive week of my Master of Teaching program, "Don't Assume", and that hit a powerful chord with me, reflecting my view on the importance of behaviour and the use of language in creating welcoming environments. In context, he was pointing out that when a student shows up late or falls asleep in class, you don't know what they have been through --- maybe their mum is sick in the hospital and they where up all night caring for her, you have no idea what they've been through. Don't Assume. That resonated with me.</p>
  
  <p>I enjoy rockclimbing, having been involved in the Climbing Club of South Australia (CCSA), the Adelaide University Mountain Club (AUMC), and University of South Australia Rockclimbing Club since 2013. I also enjoy cycling, hiking, and rogaining. I also enjoy go/igo/weiqi/baduk and helped run the University of Adelaide Go and Chess club in 2009-2011. I've also been interested in puzzles and been involved in the University of Adelaide Puzzle Club and later One Hundred Factorial group 2010-present.</p>
