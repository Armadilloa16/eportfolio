At the conclusion of semester 2 2018, David asked us to respond to a number of questions, one of which was "How can I, David, support you best in your teaching role at the MLC?". One of the comments he got from a few people (me included) was that we could learn alot by observing/ being observed during our work and getting feedback. So David implemented a plan over the summer semester for us to pair up and observe each other and give some constructive feedback/ notice things that might be useful to us, using SQUIGLES as a guide. It turned out it was more about the observer than the observed, although one of the key problems we went out of our way to try and avoid was it being perceived as an evaluation, which would have been very counter-productive. It went pretty well, I include the observations of my teaching here.
