We were tasked to make a unit plan for a topic in a SACE mathematics subject. [Instructions and rubric]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/mathUnitPlan/MathUnitPlan.docx) as well as a [summary of what we were expected to hand in and an example of a unit schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/mathUnitPlan/MathsUnitPlan_summary.docx) were provided.

I chose Stage 1 Mathematics Topic 8: Geometry, which is the same topic I did [my video task]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-16-quadrilaterals-video %}) and [lesson plan]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-28-maths-lesson-plan %}) earlier in the term. 

Here are [the unit plan I submitted]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/mathUnitPlan/Stage 1 Mathematics Topic 8 Geometry --- Unit Plan.odt) and [the associated summative investigation on circular inversion]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/mathUnitPlan/Summative Investigation Task --- Circular Inversion.odt). 

EDIT: I realised the links to the GeoGebra applets in the submitted version were not working, so I sent Ian the new links, which he said worked fine. :) The new links were:
 - (Points): [https://ggbm.at/pmNCt2UK](https://ggbm.at/pmNCt2UK)
 - (Line Segments): [https://ggbm.at/fsbGpUna](https://ggbm.at/fsbGpUna)

 - (Circles): [https://ggbm.at/bGHdZaF5](https://ggbm.at/bGHdZaF5)




I had some other ideas for summative investigations, so I thought I'd include one particularly nice one here in case I ever wanted to come back and use it, the beginning seeds I had for it are below:

# Angles subtended by an arc, arcs through two points?

We learnt that the angle at the circumference of a circle subtended by an arc of that circle is equal, so given two points, which we take to be the endpoints of an arc, we can presume that there is a circular path of points at which the angles subtended by that arc are all equal. However there are multiple circles that can be drawn through the same two points: how does the radius of the circle relate to the angle subtended by the arc? Is this related to the arc length? Does this relate to the total circumference of the circle? Etc.
