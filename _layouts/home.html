  Welcome! My name is Lyron Winderbaum, and this is my portfolio. This page has some information about me, including:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="#statement">My Personal Statement:</a> My perspective of teaching and the kind of teacher I want to be. </li>
    <li> <a href="#background">Some Background:</a> Where I am from, what I have done, and some of my influences as a teacher and a human, as well as some of the things I like to do for fun. </li>

  </ul>


  
  <h1 id="statement">Personal Statement</h1>

  <p>I aspire to be the kind of teacher that creates a safe environment in which students can interact and learn. <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-4">APST 4</a>)--> I think achieving this goal will be a lifelong journey, and not an easy one. Three core values of mine sit at the centre of my strategy for achieving this goal:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#lifelong-learning">Lifelong Learning</a></li>
    <li><a href="#transparency">Transparency</a></li>
    <li><a href="#dont-assume">Inclusive Language and Behavior</a></li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <h2 id="lifelong-learning">Lifelong Learning</h2>
  
  <p>
  In order to create a safe environment for students to interact and learn I will need to tackle obstacles of many different types: social, cultural, academic, bureaucratic, political. Perhaps most importantly of all I will need to embrace and encourage constant and ongoing self-reflection and constructive criticism. Naturally, these processes will lead to a life of constant learning <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-1">APST 1</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-2">APST 2</a>)--> and development <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-6">APST 6</a>)--> on my part as I constantly strive to improve. I embrace this, and actively seek it, relishing each chance to learn and improve.</p>

  <h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>

  <p>I value transparency highly, and aspire to be as transparent as possible in my teaching as well as in my personal development. Providing students with indepth feedback <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-5">APST 5</a>)--> is crucial for supporting learning, and I think being transparent in my assessment tasks can support this goal well. My hope is that transparency can not only improve feedback to students, but also demonstrate my dedication to integrity and encouraging collaboration. My hope that transparency will encourage collaboration applies not only to collaboration with students, but with colleagues, parents, and the community at large as well. I hope that through transparency I can also find ways to encourage stakeholders to give me feedback on how I can improve my teaching. I expect interaction with colleagues, parents, students, and the community at large <!--(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/apst#apst-7">APST 7</a>)--> to provide some of the most useful information for continual improvement as a teacher, which is my day-to-day goal even while my ultimate goal remains to create a safe environment in which students can interact and learn.</p>
  
  <h2 id="dont-assume">Inclusive Language and Behavior</h2>
  
  <p>I think thoughtful behavior and use of language are powerful tools for communicating to those around us that they are safe, not being judged, and welcome. Although sometimes these things can be subtle, I believe the impact of these subtleties can be anything but. Small and perhaps seemingly innocuous adjustments to our behavior and use of language can create massive shifts in the way people around us feel and perceive us. I think developing keener awareness of the impact of my own behaviors and use of language, and making continual adjustments, will be key to creating environments in which students can feel safe and welcome, as well as being important in developing professional relationships with colleagues, parents, and more.</p>

  <p>Since 2011 I have been working as a tutor at the Maths Learning Centre at the University of Adelaide, where I developed a love for helping people find the joy in mathematics. My journey towards becoming a teacher was long and full of detours, first pursuing a PhD in statistics (bioinformatics), then working as a postdoctoral research assistant for several years. When I finally decided to leave professional science to become a teacher, I knew I had found my passion.</p> 

  <p>Along the way I have been inspired by many people. Dan Kortchak helped me learn that thinking about problems from the perspective of a systems engineer as opposed to that of a mathematician, and helped me explore the differences. The writing of Paul Halmos inspired me with it's concise eloquence. But most of all the enthusiasm and pedagogy of David Butler's teaching practice at the Maths Learning Centre truely inspired me to be a better teacher.</p>

  <p>Brendan Bentley once said in the first intensive week of my Master of Teaching program, "Don't Assume", and that hit a powerful chord with me, reflecting my view on the importance of behaviour and the use of language in creating welcoming environments. In context, he was pointing out that when a student shows up late or falls asleep in class, you don't know what they have been through --- maybe their mum is sick in the hospital and they where up all night caring for her, you have no idea what they've been through. Don't Assume. That resonated with me.</p>
