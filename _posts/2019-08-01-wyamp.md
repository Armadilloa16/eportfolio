Today I attended the Cultural Awareness Training workshop with Wirltu Yarlu for the WYAMP program, for which I was given [a certificate of attendance]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/qualifications/wyamp-certificate.pdf). It was really good, and the speaker shared some really intense stories about her family and the past treatement of aboriginal people the scars of which carry forward into the present day.
