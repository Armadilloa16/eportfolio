(Cross, 1981: 105) </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This paper reports on aspects of a project funded by the Higher Education Funding Council run at the University of Exeter which is investigating whether the mathematics GCSE requirement for courses such as teacher education and some social sciences is a barrier to higher education for adult returners on Access courses. An earlier paper (Been and Burton, 1 993a) discussed whether the mathematics requirement is a real or a perceived barrier for those people with a strong enough commitment and motivation to enrol on an Access course. It concluded that students are arriving on Access courses with considerable anxieties about mathematics often based on bad school experiences; that the approach taken by tutors is critical in how students perceive mathematics and how they accomplish what is for some a difficult subject, both emotionally and practically; and that the provision of a mathematics component in an access course has a number of enabling roles for the students. This paper extends the analysis by considering the mathematics requirement with particular reference to the constituent groups in Access. We also establish whether mathematics is a deterrent for those who are at the early stages of considering a return to study. </p><a id="AN9502226099-2" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9502226099-2" title="Research Design and Methodology">Research Design and Methodology</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two questionnaires on attitudes to mathematics, one for the students already on Access courses and one for individuals enquiring about Access (enquiry group) were tested in a pilot survey. The questionnaire for the student group was then sent as a postal survey to 111 randomly selected institutions offering Access to social science and humanities courses (20% national sample) and Access to teacher education courses (100% national sample) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (Jones, 1992). </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The sample returns for the survey were: on the Access to social science and humanities courses, 70 courses sampled, 64 returned; on the Access to teacher education, 39 courses sampled, 28 returned. The overall return rate was 84%. Individual returns from students were: Access to social science and humanities, 53%; Access to teacher education, 54%. The total number of returns was 1471. The questionnaires were completed in the second half of the autumn term, 1992. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Those for the enquiry group were taken to five 'invitation to Access' open evenings in Plymouth and Exeter and to two open days run by the Careers Advice Office in Plymouth. A total of 253 questionnaires were completed in the spring/summer of 1993. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Likert attitude scale[1] was developed to test whether mathematics was a barrier to Higher Education. The attitude scale consisted of ten questions which were piloted and the internal reliability tested using the Cronbach alpha.[2] For the total population studied the Likert attitude scale has a Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.8552 and hence is statistically valid and has internal reliability. </p><a id="AN9502226099-3" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9502226099-3" title="Targeting in Access Provision">Targeting in Access Provision</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Before considering the mathematics barrier in relation to certain groups, the importance of targeting in the Access philosophy will be briefly reviewed. The Department of Education and Science's Letter of Invitation (DES, 1978) emphasised the educational and social inequalities which were the spur to this new initiative through which the Government hoped to ensure that 'all members of the community have equal opportunities to develop their attitudes and abilities to the full'. The Letter invited eight selected local education authorities to consider establishing new courses which would 'encourage the entry into the professions and responsible posts in worthwhile careers of those whose background or experience could prove valuable, but who lack the requisite qualifications for entry to the appropriate training course' (author's emphasis). </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The purpose of this initiative was to encourage young people and suitable adults from the ethnic minorities to enter higher education. The Letter asked for `special preparatory courses' to assist ethnic minority goups in particular to qualify for training in teaching, social work and similar professions. Lieven (1989) and Millins (1984) suggest that this was in part a government response to the serious injustices and inequality faced by the black communities. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, the Letter of Invitation, while implying that the courses should be aimed at the ethnic minorities, also made an equal opportunities statement across the whole of the community. This was soon taken by educators to include not only the disadvantaged ethnic minorities but also other groups within society that had previously been under-represented in higher education, notably women and men from working-class backgrounds. Lieven notes that: </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Already a government response to a specific problem was being creatively transformed by educators into the tradition of using adult education as a tool to counter systematically created disadvantage. (Lieven, 1989: 161) </p><a id="AN9502226099-4" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9502226099-4" title="Educational Inequality and Barriers to Higher Education">Educational Inequality and Barriers to Higher Education</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The 1944 Education Act (HMSO, 1944) called for 'equality of opportunity and parity of esteem'. However in the Oxford Social Mobility Survey, Halsey, Heath and Ridge (1980) concluded that the Education Act had 'brought Britain no nearer meritocracy or equality of opportunity'. They argued that it had been the privileged groups in society that had made the most gains from the expansion of educational services. Thus, as Giddens (1989: 423) suggests, 'education tends to express and reaffirm existing inequalities far more than it acts to change them'. It is the recognition of these inequalities in education that informs and directs the Access movement. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The educational inequalities which are directly related to class, gender and race in primary and secondary education and the addition of age in the adult sphere have a strong effect upon participation in educational activities. The social apartheid that these four characteristics encompass creates barriers to participation for a wide-ranging group of students, in particular: </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">those groups who have been least well-served by the school system and who face particular barriers to entry to higher education. These include ethnic minorities, especially the black communities; women, especially those who, through early parenthood or the need to work, had to abandon their education; and working class adults, especially the unemployed, whose talents may not have been fully recognised at the secondary stage. (Further Education Unit, 1987) </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition to these fundamental social barriers there are other significant barriers to education placed in the way of these 'non-traditional' students. Parry (1989) suggests that despite the 'language of openness, flexibility and transferability' used by the educational institutions, there are cultural barriers buried deep in the ideological psyche of many higher education institutions which, in a very real way,  dispossess those who do not fit into what Parry argues is </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">an elite system of higher education [which] has required the maintenance of a strong boundary between itself and other sources of learning in order to protect the qualities invested in 'higher' education. That boundary has reinforced a notion of discontinuity and distance from other forms of learning, yet arrangements for crossing the boundary have assamed continuity and articulation. (Pawy, 1989: 15) </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Thus this ideological reinforcing of a 'boundary' which needs to be crossed by the student conforming to a ritualised custom based upon often meaningless examinations is for Griffin (1983) the key to origins of further barriers for the students: </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For the problem of access is seen primarily in terms of the access of individuals (either as such or else as members of particular groups) to learning opportunities, the barriers to which are constituted in wholly material terms. In  fact barriers to access are collectively as much as individually experienced and culturally as well as materially constructed, and the paradox lies in confronting the individual learner with the problem of the socially and culturally constructed contents of learning. All the barriers likely to be experienced in these circumstances are equally real, but access does seem to be conceptualised in terms which ignore the cultural barriers, which isolate and abstract the individual learner, and which tend to reduce the issue to one wholly resolvable in technical and institutional terms. There is little sense here that access to education might lie a collective and political issue of knowledge and power in society. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Thus the Access movement, in answer to some of these concerns, has taken a strategic decision to focus upon 'designated courses, targeted audiences, selected sectors, consecutive stages, specified routes and guaranteed places' (Further Education Unit, 1987) or, as Woodrow (1988) suggests, become an agent of change for those groups which are under-represented in higher education. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Much research then has been expended upon the social and the cultural barriers to access. This paper will consider the social variables of class, age, ethnicity, and gender. However we will move away from the traditional frame of analysis by considering these social variables in relation to mathematics rather than as an intrinsic source of inequality in themselves. </p><a id="AN9502226099-5" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9502226099-5" title="Summary of Results">Summary of Results</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The survey showed that Access providers have a firm belief that anyone entering higher education should be numerate. Mathematics GCSE is also an entry requirement to teacher education and some social science courses in higher education. Consequently mathematics is usually provided as an integral part of the course or students are directed to an alternative form of mathematics provision. Therefore a high proportion of Access students are attending a mathematics course. Respondents' attitudes to mathematics were identified in two ways. There was a direct question 'Is mathematics a barrier for you?'. But in addition a Likert Attitude Scale, consisting of ten questions, was developed to test indirectly the deterrent effect of mathematics. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The social classifications considered were gender, class, age, race, those with little in the way of formal qualifications, and those with no mathematics qualification. For the questions regarding ethnic origin we have in general abided by the 1991 Census classifications. 'Black' is taken to mean people of African, African Asian, Bangladeshi, Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani, Sri-Lankan, and Mauritian origin. 'Other' includes Arab, Greek, South-East Asian, Turkish. 'White' is taken to mean people originating from the United Kingdom, western and northern Europe and the USA. Low qualifications here is taken to mean the equivalent of four 'O' Levels or less. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 1 shows the percentage of the total cohort in each category. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 2 is based on the results of the Likert Attitude Scale where a score of 0 indicates that mathematics is not a barrier and one of 40 indicates that mathematics is a high barrier. The table is based on the median scores for the various social groups. There are some gaps in entries for the enquiry group because the numbers were so small as to be insignificant. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 3 is based on the results of the question 'Is mathematics a barrier for you?'. Respondents were asked to score their answers on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 indicated no barrier and 10 a high barrier. Table 3 gives the percentages of each group that gave answers between 7 and 10 (i.e. who felt that mathematics was a high barrier). </p><a id="AN9502226099-6" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9502226099-6" title="Analysis">Analysis</a></h3></span><a id="AN9502226099-7" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> Cohort  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first and most obvious conclusion to draw from these results is that there is a sizable proportion of each of our groups who consider mathematics to be a high barrier for themselves, and this is true whether the question is asked directly or indirectly. Our earlier paper (Been and Burton, 1993a) showed, by students' comments, that these attitudes were being changed for those on Access courses. Nevertheless these figures indicate an area that must concern all Access providers. It is also important to note that respondents express more concern when asked directly if mathematics is a barrier. This is perhaps not surprising as the very question may cause them to recall not only their own experiences and fears of mathematics but also the negative views of mathematics within our society. </p><a id="AN9502226099-8" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> The Enquiry Group  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This group expressed higher anxiety levels both as a cohort and for all its subgroups. This has important implications for recruitment since a significant proportion of interested people may be deterred at this stage by their fear of mathematics. Pre-admision publicity needs to alleviate the apprehension prospective students experience regarding their lack of mathematics ability but words alone are not sufficient. Pre-course mathematics workshops on a drop-in basis could give students both a taster of the teaching approach and raise their confidence levels. Current access students present at open evenings and available to tell their stories can also give reassurance. There is a fine dividing line between giving prospective students a clear and realistic picture of what will be expected of them and an over-emphasising of commitment and levels of ability required. But the former is essential in any quality educational provision and the latter can have a further disabling effect upon students already disabled through anxieties about their capabilities and concerns about how to fit in their study around already difficult and often complex family life. </p><a id="AN9502226099-9" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> No Mathematical Qualification  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It comes as no surprise that people with no mathematics qualification upon leaving school see mathematics as a barrier to higher education and exhibit the highest levels of anxiety. Again this poses a dilemma for Access providers. Access is premised on the notion of open entry but it is clear from both our statistics and an analysis of individual comments that some people are entering or considering entering Access courses with very low levels of mathematical knowledge. Some of these people wish to progress to teacher education or the social sciences and so need the mathematics qualification. It is noted from sources such as the Cockcroft Report (1982) that learning mathematics takes time. Indeed Cockcroft notes that 'A frequent complaint [from students] has been that insufficient time is given to curriculum and method work' (Cockcroft: 209). Tutors on Access also recognise the constraints time imposed upon their students' mathematics development. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It may be that people in this group should be counselled to take a mathematics course prior to Access or seriously consider alternative routes that do not require mathematics. This is not to suggest pre-course testing but educational guidance. If this seems inimical to the Access ethos, then so were some of the sad comments of students who had failed to achieve their goal at the end of the Access course due to failure at mathematics. One woman who had passed the mathematics examination on the Access course at her third attempt, commented: </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">I would have just carried on and kept trying - I mean I took it twice - I took it at school and I took it when I left shcool and failed miserably. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, our results would suggest that this group is vulnerable and does need careful counselling. </p><a id="AN9502226099-10" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> Low Level of Non-mathematical Qualifications  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The authors had anticipated that this group might see mathematics as a high barrier but, for those on Access, this group shows no exceptional problem. The enquirers however do show higher levels of anxiety and perhaps need particular reassurance at open evenings. </p><a id="AN9502226099-11" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> Gender  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is clear from the above results that women, whether on Access or enquiring, or whether asked directly or indirectly, show more anxiety about mathematics than men. The women in the enquiry group showed particular fear. There are many cultural explanations for this. Women and girls are discouraged from studying mathematics because of its masculine image (Astin and Myint, 1971; Rose and Elton, 1971; Trecker, 1971; Walkerdine, 1989). Ironically girls at high school fail to view mathematics as important to them for their later careers (Pedro and others, 1981; Wilson and Boldizar, 1990). This, as Fennema and Sherman (1977) and Sherman and Fennema (1977) have shown, has a major effect on females' confidence with mathematics both at school and in later life. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mathematics has thus become a barrier within a gender-specified educational system where boys were directed to the scientific subjects and girls to the more caring and artistic subjects (Weinreich-Haste, 1986). The consequences of this segregation is that mathematics within schools still disadvantages women despite the corrective attempts of many educationists (Burton, 1987a and b; Benbow, 1988; Walkerdine, 1989; Burton, 1990). This negative effect appears in the classroom. As Walden and Walkerdine (1985: 44) have shown, teachers have tended to enter girls for low level examinations rather than the GCSE/GSE which is 'the most prestigious examination and more acceptable to future employers' and is also used as an entry requirement for some courses of higher education. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, it is also essential to note cultural pressures on men. As Fennema and Sherman (1976) and Brush (1978) suggest, in studies of maths anxiety which show women being more 'maths anxious' than men, the researchers have not allowed for the fact that men may be more socialised into not openly displaying their anxiety. In addition women may be actively encouraged by their socialising to feel able to admit to their anxiety. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It would seem that both at open days and in early mathematics sessions on the Access course, tutors need to discuss these cultural experiences and expectations with both men and women to raise awareness in the students that earlier failure in mathematics may be due to this socio-cultural reality rather than their own inadequacy. </p><a id="AN9502226099-12" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> Race  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The small number of people from ethnic minorities in the enquiry group makes it impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions. In the Access group, 7.8% were 'Black' which compares well with the 5.5% for the whole population in the 1991 Census. As a group, 'Black' people showed the same score as 'White' people on the Likert Scale, with Africans and Caribbeans showing higher anxiety when the group is broken down. The results of the direct question about mathematics as a barrier indicated greater problems for the 'Black' group. Each sub-group of 'Black' minorities had a higher percentage stating that mathematics was, for them, a high barrier than for the cohort. Although some of the group sizes are small, this indicates a worrying trend. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To understand this situation more clearly, visits were made to two Access courses for Asians in Bradford. The interviews with the Asian students suggested three sources for their higher anxiety in mathematics. Firstly their recollections of school suggest an undercurrent of racism in their teachers. There was a definite perception that teachers had had low expectation of them and so achieving success in mathematics had not been seen by either pupils or teachers as important. There was also a clear picture of family culture and pressures mitigating particularly against Asian girls doing well at school. Some parents had feared the freedom and independence that education could bring and had discouraged study insisting that, for the girls, helping in the home took precedence over study. Finally many of the group had been confused and intimidated by the language of mathematics. This problem, not confined to ethnic minorities, is exacerbated if English is the second language. Some of these problems are socio-cultural and beyond the control of Access tutors but there are approaches that can help. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Anderson (1990) and Joseph (1987) both show that the present structure of mathematics education is inherently Eurocentric and consequently the curricula 'reinforce[s] the racial and sexual inferiority complexes among people of colour and women' (Anderson, 1990: 349). Anderson argues that mathematics teachers have to break down the walls of Eurocentrism and place mathematics within its historical and cultural setting to 'shatter the myth that mathematics . . . is a "white man's thing" and [to emphasise] . . . that all civilizations . . . are bound inextricably to each other' (Anderson, 1990: 355). Anderson has developed a non-Eurocentric approach to mathematics teaching that endeavours to ensure the relevance of mathematics. The early sessions are discussions on the historical, cultural, and socio-political implications of mathematics. At all stages an emphasis is placed on the role of other races and cultures in the development of the subject. The importance of mathematics to real people in real life is drawn out by regular class discussions of current issues in the social and natural sciences, the development of technology and job market skills. The emphasis is on the quality of mathematics knowledge rather than the quantity, thus reducing the time pressure. The creation of study groups allows collective study and in-class group work. Anderson claims that this approach leads to students having a more positive, self-assured attitude about themselves successfully doing mathematics with the consequence that failure and dropout rates fall considerably. </p><a id="AN9502226099-13" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> Age  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our results do not indicate a clear correlation between age and anxiety about mathematics. </p><a id="AN9502226099-14" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> Class  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Empirical research has traditionally used the Registrar General's (RG) classification of occupations as the method of classifying people in the social structure. However, past theoretical and research debates concerning social classification and women (Stanworth, 1984; Middleton, 1974; Ritter and Hargens, 1975) would suggest that perceptions of women on Access gained through use of this classification may not bear close relation to reality. Work on this project published elsewhere (Been and Burton, 1993b) agrees with this contention and hence we do not feel able to draw any conclusions on whether links exist between class and anxiety with mathematics. </p><a id="AN9502226099-15" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> Implications for Access  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In our prevous paper (Been and Burton, 1993a) we considered how bad experiences at school for many students raise grave personal doubts about their ability not only to do mathematics but to succeed in post-secondary education at all.

To reduce this deterrent factor, practitioners need to constantly consider admissions procedures and processes and monitor their approach to the mathematics component. Certain groups of students are particularly vulnerable and these may need special attention. As always in adult education, there is the difficult job of balancing the need in the current education funding climate to recruit students who will successfully complete while keeping the door open so that 'all members of the community have equal opportunities to develop their attitudes and abilities to the full' (DES, 1978). It is crucial to widen Access but not to have access students fail yet again because of the pressure of the mathematics component of the course. </p><div class="center" xmlns:Translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 1.
