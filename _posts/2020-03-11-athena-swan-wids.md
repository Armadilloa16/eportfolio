Today I went to a lecture on the [Athena SWAN accrediation](https://www.sciencegenderequity.org.au/the-athena-swan-accreditation-framework/) process at UWA. It was great to hear people in the university discussing the issue, including a Danish panellist discussing cultural differences from Denmark to the UK to Australia, flexbile work arrangements as an incentive for keeping good staff, and much more. I also met an awesome Maori woman after and we bonded about student support. 

Later in the evening, I then attended the [WiDS Perth panel](https://www.uwa.edu.au/ems/ems-events/wids-perth-2020) which was also fantastic, although afterwards I had an unfortunate interaction with an industry data scientist.
