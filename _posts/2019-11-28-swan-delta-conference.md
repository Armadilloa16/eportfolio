Today I attended the Swan Delta Conference (Teachers Day). There were quite a few interesting talks, including one on ChooseMaths by Janine. I met a huge number of interesting people, and really felt re-connected to "my people" --- i.e. the teaching profession. I got to meet Chris Matthews and chat with him briefly which was... incredible. Honestly that man, is my hero, and getting to meet him in person and chat was a dream come true. I would love to become more involved in ATSIMA in the future... hopefully I can find some avenue for making that happen.

I got [a certificate of partitipation]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/PD/Swan_Delta_2019/swan_delta_certificate.pdf).
