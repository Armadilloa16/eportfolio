We were given a folio of 4 SATs, and also an Investigation from a student last year (2017). I won't include them here, for privacy reasons. We were then instructed to individually grade each of these assessment types (without consulting with our peers), and post our suggested grade along with a short justification. To help me consider the performance standards individually I used [the tables I made]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-24-maths-sace-performance-standards %}). Below I include the posts I made to the discussion posts:

For the SATs:
<blockquote markdown="1">
I would give this student a B overall for these SATs.

I would give them: A for RC5, B for CT1, CT2, CT4, RC2, RC3, and C for RC1 and RC4, and all up that would average out to a B. 

But the first thing I'd like to say is that I'm really uncertain about those grades. RC5 for example, the only clear RC5 questions were is SAT 3 (Q4 (c) and (d)), which where answered perfectly, but I would have liked to have seen at least one (preferably two) more conjecture/proof questions to be confident in giving an A-grade for RC5. Otherwise, there was  a mixture of very well answered questions and very poorly answered questions. It seemed like many of the poorly answered questions (or sub-parts of questions) seemed to be interpretation and communication (RC1 and RC4) questions more often than not (such as SAT 4, Q7 (d) and similar). Although some were also answered well (SAT 6 Q7 (a) (iii) for example). Like I said, there was a mixture of well-answered questions and poorly-answered questions. One interesting thing I noticed was that sometimes questions testing the same concepts would fall into both categories (well-answered and poorly-answered). For example, in SAT 1, Q4 tested "differentiation of trig functions" and "find the equation for a tangent to a function at a point" and was answered poorly. However, Q8 (a) showed this student could "find the equation for a tangent to a function at a point", and Q6 showed this as well at an even higher difficulty. Furthermore, Q2 (b) shows that this student could differentiate trig functions... which makes me wonder about if the time-constraints of doing SATs might be contributing to some of the poorly answered questions, running out of time rather than demonstrating a lack of knowledge perhaps. Something to keep in mind maybe.

and for the Investigation:
<blockquote markdown="1">
I would give this student an A for this investigation (agreeing with the grade written on it). 

They chose some challenging functions (CT1), communicated and interpreted (RC1, RC4) their results and calculations very well. The discussion was insightful (for example ``this would also make it easier for builders to install the hydraulic launch system as they would be placed at ground level rather than up in the air) and well explained, including the discussion of limitations (RC2). Appropriate mathematics was used to ensure smoothness and such, and this was done effectively (CT2). All the points mentioned so far show evidence at an A-level easily in my oppinion. One point I disagree with the ticks on the front page of the document is that I would give them an A for CT4 (use of technology) as well, as they made all their plots well, and I disagree that they should have used technology for much of their calculations --- they could have, and that would also have been equally correct but I don't think doing the calculations long-hand deserves to assign them a B for CT4. Still, there were some downsides, for example the incorrect use of "centres" in the discussion of the Clothoid, and the discussion/ conclusion was slightly repetitive at times. Overall the assignment was really great and I did consider giving it an A+ but I ended up not being able to justify it to myself... there were just enough tiny little imperfections, but the main thing that kept me from giving it a A+ was just that I felt like in the discussion of the limitations and such, although the student did a great job, it just didn't seem to go the extra mile i would expect for an A+. Maybe this deserves an A+, but I would give it an A all things considered.
