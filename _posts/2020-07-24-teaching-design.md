It's been awhile since I've updated this blog, COVID has been abit of a time-dilating-bubble. 

Recently I've been thinking about how to modify the teaching delivery of a course I'll be (co-)teaching in second semester of 2020. I'm quite restricted in how many changes I can make (I'd like to do more), but I'm happy I've had a chance to review the computer labs and ensure I am happy with them at least. That, in combination with the assessment strategy and the good quality textbook makes me feel better that the students will have plenty of opportunity to succeed. We'll see how it goes. I should write some more on what my intentions where with the modifications I made and then review to see how it went during/ afterwards.
