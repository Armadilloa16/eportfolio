We where set a task to select a resource which could be incorporated into the teaching of SACE Stage 1 or Stage 2 Chemistry. 

I chose [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) to present on, see the 
Analysis Table [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/resources/files/FeynmanLectures.docx) (one of the key assessment items), and slides [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/resources/feynman.html) for my 3-5min presentation on the topic.

I actually looked into quite a few other resources as well, so I'll include them here as well for later reference:
- [Scootle](https://www.scootle.edu.au), Australian Curriculum material up to year 10, I almost picked this resource for my assignment actually and even prepared an Analysis Table, see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/assignments/resources/files/Scootle.docx).
- [Things I won't work with blog](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/) is a really cool blog on really dangerous chemicals, maybe not school friendly though as Glen suggested kids trying to copy things might be a concern, although the author also writes some nice articles on other topics that might be relevant to SHE.
- [VisChem](http://www.vischem.com.au/) has some really nice videos and other resources, and is actually linked with the Scootle site too.
- [CLEAPSS Lab Handbook](http://science.cleapss.org.uk/Resources/Laboratory-Handbook/) I think was intended mostly for lab techs but has some really nice practical ideas in it.
- [MolView](http://molview.org/) is a really nice website where you can put in a molecular structure and get a three dimensional model of the molecule to play with.
- [This](http://www.flinnsci.com/api/library/Download/16dd2a91c31747daa2e7505ea6f0d7af) is a nice example of a resource from [FLINN Scientific](http://www.flinnsci.com/), a cool website with a bunch of resources.
