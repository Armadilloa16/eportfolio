  <h1>Personal Statement</h1>

  <img src="files/photos/shedidit.jpg" alt="Profile Photo" style="float:right;width:240px">

  <p>Since 2011 I have been working as a tutor at the Maths Learning Centre at the University of Adelaide, where I developed a love for helping people find the joy in mathematics. My journey towards becoming a teacher was long and full of detours, first pursuing a PhD in statistics (bioinformatics), then working as a postdoctoral research assistant for several years. When I finally decided to leave professional science to become a teacher, I knew I had found my passion.</p> 


  <p>Along the way I have been inspired by many people. Dan Kortchak helped me learn that thinking about problems from the perspective of a systems engineer as opposed to that of a mathematician, and helped me explore the differences. The writing of Paul Halmos inspired me with it's concise eloquence. But most of all the enthusiasm and pedagogy of David Butler's teaching practice at the Maths Learning Centre truely inspired me to be a better teacher.</p>
