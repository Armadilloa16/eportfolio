Here I will summarise my evidence and artefacts from my placements relating to assessment, so specifically as they relate to APST 5, and APST 2.3.

There are two main categories in terms of assessment: 
 - Formative, and
 - Summative.
 
# Formative Assessment.
 
In my practice formative assessment has often been largely informal, through conversations with students, asking them directed questions and evaluating their answers for understanding. As such, collecting evidence and artefacts for it can be tricky, although my knowledge of their learning from these practices is often reflected in my lesson planning, as I adjust my teaching to match with their learning. Specific examples of this include:

My formative assessment practice is also reflected in feedback I've received from colleagues and mentors observing my teaching. Examples of this include:

# Summative Assessment. 
Across my two teaching placements, first at Norwood Morialta Highschool (NMHS) and then at Blackwood Highschool (BHS), I have had the opportunity to deliver, mark, and provide feedback on quite a few summative assessment items:
 - At BHS  I marked my [year 10 science classes inertia prac reports]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-20-inertia-report-marking %}) and gave them feedback on how to improve. [Later on with the same year 10 science class]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-29-week-4-science %}), I ran their next summative prac, one involving bouncing balls, and when doing so I attempted to structure the lessons leading up to their prac report writing around the gaps in understanding that I had identified when marking their inertia prac reports.
 - At BHS I marked my [year 10 maths classes movies directed investigation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-23-movies-task-marking %}) and gave them feedback on how to improve.
